NaNoGenMo
=========

[National Novel Generation Month][1] coincides with [NaNoWriMo][2], the goal of each is
to write a novel of at least 50,000 words.  NaNoWriMo focuses on writing a book
manually, however NaNoGenMo is for writing programs that write books. See the
official [NaNoGenMo site][1] for rules, participation instructions, and a
wealth of discussions and resources from previous years.

This Repository is where I'll keep my entries, sorted by year.  These are the
scripts I'm going to use to generate a few "novels." I will not be including
any copyrighted materials in this repository, but will be generating texts from
potentially copyrighted materials; any applicable copyright remains with it's
author/creator.
