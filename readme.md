NaNoGenMo
=========

National Novel Generation Month coincides with NaNoWriMo, the goal of each is to write a novel of at least 50,000 words.
NaNoWriMo focuses on writing a book manually, however NaNoGenMo is for writing programs that write books.

This Repository is where I'll keep my entries, sorted by year.
These are the scripts I'm going to use to generate a few "novels."
I will not be including any copyrighted materials in this repository, but will be generating texts from potentially copyrighted materials;
any applicable copyright remains with it's author/creator.
