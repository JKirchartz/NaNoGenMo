<p>Since I'm not the same person as I was before the eclipse, I might try some new things, but I still want to get <a href="https://github.com/JKirchartz/NaNoGenMo/tree/master/2016/BeatlesBible">"Beatles Bible"</a> working converting song lyrics to a chapter &amp; verse reference (maybe update to py3, maybe buy into a better lyrics API)</p>
<p>If I can get my <a href="https://github.com/JKirchartz/Glitchy3bitdither">Glitchy3bitDither</a> project updated in time, I want to try to use that to generate a comic-book-style AESTHETIC look book.</p>
<p>Maybe something with tracery? I need to improve my tracery chops. What I'd really like to do is take a written work, run it through a parts of speech tagger of some sort, and turn those tags into tracery lists so that I can randomize the content of the book without changing the structure.</p>


<p>As it happens, [@nossidge has] a <a href="https://mega.nz/#!ASBxRYrA!Ko01ovAqYRuPAKDuhj1V5-HpJ7eWe21OilyEelSCXpg">folder</a> full of Beatles song lyrics.<br>
Hope it helps, in case you hadn't sourced the data yet.</p>
