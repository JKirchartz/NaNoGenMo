Beatles Bible
------------

I still wanted to get [Beatles Bible][1] working converting song lyrics to a
chapter &amp; verse reference, and after previous issues sourcing the corpus I
was fortunate @nossidge offered a [folder][3] full of Beatles lyrics.

so again, I reiterate:

> Music has always been a religious experience for me, perhaps easily
> referencable lyrics will have an effect on future theologians.

Presenting: [The Complete Beatles Bible][6]



Artbook
-------

Since updating my [Glitchy3bitDither][2] project to run in node.js I was able
to script some graphic components to go with the generated text to create a
comic-book-style AESTHETIC look book. Combining Markov with tracery, I sourced
some dada &amp; other manifestos from [391.org][4] and [textfiles.com][5],
creating a corpus for Markov to work with, and using a POS tagger to generate a
tracery file to generate sentences with similar sentence structure to source
materials.
