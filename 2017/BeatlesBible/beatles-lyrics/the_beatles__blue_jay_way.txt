[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
There's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

[Chorus]
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 2]
Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

[Chorus]
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 3]
Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way

[Chorus]
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
For I may be asleep
