[Intro]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

[Verse 1]
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 2]
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 3]
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Verse 4]
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

[Chorus]
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

[Outro ]
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Can you take me back where I came from
Brother, can you take me back
Can you take me back
Mm, can you take where I came from
Can you take me back
