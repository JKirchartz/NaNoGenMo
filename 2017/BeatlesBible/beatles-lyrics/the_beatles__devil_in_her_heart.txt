[Chorus]
She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalize
She's going to tear your heart apart
Oh her lips they really thrill me

[Verse 1]
I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

[Chorus]
She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's going to tear your heart apart
No, no way will she deceive

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
Listen can't you see

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me
