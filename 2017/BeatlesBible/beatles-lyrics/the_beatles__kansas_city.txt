[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, Kansas City
Going to get my baby back home
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to Kansas City
Going to get my baby back home
Yeah, yeah
Well, it's a long, long, time
Since my baby's been gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, Kansas City
Going to to get my baby on time
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to Kansas City
Going to get my baby on time
Yeah, yeah
It's just a one, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, wah

[Chorus] [x2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, baby, woo no clown
I say you're no clown
Now, now, now, now
Tell me baby
What's been wrong with you

[Outro]
Well, I'll say bye
Bye, bye, baby bye, bye
Oh, so long
Bye, bye, baby I'm gone
Yeah, I said
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye

Well, I'll say bye
Bye, bye, baby bye, bye
