[Pre-Chorus]
Woh yeh, oh yeh
Imagine, I'm in love with you
It's easy because I know
I've imagined, I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse]
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue

So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

Well, there's going to be a time
When I'm going to change your mind (When i'm gonna make you mine)
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
