[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true...today
Came true...today
Came true... today...yes it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
