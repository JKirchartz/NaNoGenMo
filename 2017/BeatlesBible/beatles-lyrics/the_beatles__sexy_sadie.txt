[Verse 1]
Sexy Sadie what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie ooh what have you done?

[Verse 2]
Sexy Sadie you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie oooh you broke the rules

[Verse 3]
One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover (Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie the greatest of them all

[Verse 4]
Sexy Sadie how did you know
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know?

[Verse 5]
Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie oooh you'll get yours yet

[Verse 6]
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie she's the latest and the greatest of them all

[Outro]
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie

However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie
