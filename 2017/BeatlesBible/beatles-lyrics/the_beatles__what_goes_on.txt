[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 1]
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 2]
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
