[Verse 1]
She said, I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

[Chorus 1]
I said, who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born

She said, you don't understand what I said
I said, no, no, no, you're wrong
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Chorus 2]
I said, even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Because you're making me feel like I've never been born

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
She said, I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead
