[Verse]
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

[Chorus]
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
Aww

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
