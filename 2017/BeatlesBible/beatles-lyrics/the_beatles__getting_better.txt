[Intro]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down
Turning me round
Filling me up with your rules

[Chorus 1]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's a little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

[Verse 2]
Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Getting so much better all the time!

[Chorus 3]
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

[Verse 3]
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]
