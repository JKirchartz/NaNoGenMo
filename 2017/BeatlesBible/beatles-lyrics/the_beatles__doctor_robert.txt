[Verse 1]
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 1]
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Verse 2]
If you're down he'll pick you up
Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 2]
Doctor Robert
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Doctor Robert

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

[Verse 3]
My friend works for the National Health
Doctor Robert
You'll pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert

[Chorus 1]
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 2]
Doctor Robert
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Doctor Robert

[Outro]
Ring my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Ring my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
