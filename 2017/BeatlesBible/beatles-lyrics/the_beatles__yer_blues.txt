[Chorus]
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

[Verse 1]
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

[Chorus]
