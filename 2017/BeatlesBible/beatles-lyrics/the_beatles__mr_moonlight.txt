[Verse 1]
Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight

[Chorus]
Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight

[Verse 2]
And the night you don't come my way
Oh, I'll pray and pray more each day
Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight

[Chorus]

Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
