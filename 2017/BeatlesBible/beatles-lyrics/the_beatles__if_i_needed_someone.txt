[Verse]
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Chorus]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Hook]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Chorus]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Hook]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah
