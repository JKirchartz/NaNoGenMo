{Intro}

I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here wonderin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I've never been happy cause everything I
Ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery

Allright!

{Bridge}

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

Well, I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go
