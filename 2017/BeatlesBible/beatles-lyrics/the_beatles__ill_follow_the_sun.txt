[Chorus 1]
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Bridge]
Some day, you'll know
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 3]
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus 4]
One day, you'll find
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Yeah tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]
