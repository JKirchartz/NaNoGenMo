[Verse]
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

[Pre-Chorus]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Chorus]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
