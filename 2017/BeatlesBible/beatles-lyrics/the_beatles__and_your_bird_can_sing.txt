[Verse 1]
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

[Verse 2]
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

[Verse 3]
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be round, I'll be round

[Verse 4]
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be round, I'll be round

[Verse 5]
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me
