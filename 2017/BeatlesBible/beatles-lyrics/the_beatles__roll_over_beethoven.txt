[Verse 1]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I got to hear it again today

[Verse 2]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My hearts beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rolling arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
We're rocking in two by two

[Verse 4]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two, oh

[Verse 5]
Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
Going to play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She got a crazy partner
Ought to see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues
