[Verse 1]
Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world

[Verse 3]
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world

[Verse 3]
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm
