[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 1]
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 2]
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 3]
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
