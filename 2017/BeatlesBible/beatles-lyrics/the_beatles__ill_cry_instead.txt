[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-ay
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
