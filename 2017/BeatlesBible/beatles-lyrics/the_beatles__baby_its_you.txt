[Intro]
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

[Interlude]
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart (sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

[Verse 1]
Uh, oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself, 'cause baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la)

You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat"
They say, they say you never never never ever been true (cheat cheat)

[Verse 2]
Uh oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do, and it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (sha la la la la la la)

[Chorus]
Uh oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby, it's you. (sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you. (sha la la la la la la)
Don't leave me all alone
Come on home...
