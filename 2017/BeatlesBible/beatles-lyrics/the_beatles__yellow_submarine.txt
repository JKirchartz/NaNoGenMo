[Verse 1]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2]
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3]
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Bridge]
Full speed ahead, Mr. Parker, full speed ahead
Full speed over here, sir
Action station, action station
Aye, aye, sir, fire
Heaven, heaven

[Verse 4]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need  (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (and sea of green)
In our (In our) yellow submarine (yellow submarine, ha-ha!)

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
