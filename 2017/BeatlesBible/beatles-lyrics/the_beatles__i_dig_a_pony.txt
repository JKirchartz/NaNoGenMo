[Verse 1]
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!

I do a road hog
Well you can penetrate any place you go
Yes you can penetrate any place you go

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 2]
I pick a moon dog
Well you can radiate everything you are
Yes you can radiate everything you are

Oh now
I roll a stoney
Well you can imitate everyone you know
Yes you can imitate everyone you know

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 3]
Ooh now
I feel the wind blow
Well you can indicate everything you see
Yes you can indicate everything you see

Oh now
I load a lorry
Well you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah you can syndicate any boat you row

[Chorus]
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because
