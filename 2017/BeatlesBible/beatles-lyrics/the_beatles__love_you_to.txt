[Verse 1]
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

[Verse 2]
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

[Verse 3]
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

[Verse 4]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Verse 5]
There's people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see

[Verse 6]
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
