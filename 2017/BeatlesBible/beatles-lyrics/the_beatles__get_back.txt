Sweet Loretta Fart she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan

[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
Go home

{​​Interlude}​​

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
Go home

[Electric Piano Solo]

Get back, Jo

[Verse 2]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
Go home

[Verse 3]
Get back, Loretta
Your mama's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
Go home

I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition
