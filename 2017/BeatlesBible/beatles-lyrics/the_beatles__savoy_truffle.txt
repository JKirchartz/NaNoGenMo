[Chorus 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

[Chorus 2]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 2]
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You're going to shout aloud

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
