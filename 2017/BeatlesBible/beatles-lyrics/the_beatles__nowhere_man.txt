[Chorus 1]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

[Verse 1]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Chorus 2]
Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

[Verse 2]
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?

[Chorus 2]
Nowhere Man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

[Verse 3]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Chorus 2]
Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command

[Chorus 1]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
