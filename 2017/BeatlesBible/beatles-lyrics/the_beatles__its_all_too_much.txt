[Intro]
It's all too much
It's all too much

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Verse 2]
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

[Verse 3]
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah
We all get too much

[Bridge]
Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a[x7]
Too much a

[Outro]
Much, much, much, much, much[x5]
