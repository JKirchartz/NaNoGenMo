[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
