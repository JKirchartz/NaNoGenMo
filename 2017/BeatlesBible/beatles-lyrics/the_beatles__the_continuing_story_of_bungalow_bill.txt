[Chorus x2]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 1]
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

[Chorus x2]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 2]
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

[Chorus x2]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

[Verse 3]
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
