[Verse 1]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus 1]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man avail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus 2]
And started playing that that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a Congo
So keep a rocking that piano

[Chorus 1]
