[Chorus 1]
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You think you lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say

[Chorus 2]
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

[Verse 2]
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she said she knows
You're not the hurting kind

[Chorus 2]
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

[Chorus 1]
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad

[Verse 3]
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you, too
Apologise to her

[Chorus 2]
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

[Chorus 1]
[She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]

[Hook] [x2]
With a love like that
You know you should
Be Glad!

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah!
