[Intro]
For I have got another girl, another girl

[Verse 1]
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, "This time you'd better stop"

[Verse 2]
For I have got another girl
Another girl, who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

[Verse 3]
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl, who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

[Verse 4]
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl. Another girl
Another girl
