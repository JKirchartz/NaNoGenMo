[Intro]

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Ooh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week

[Verse 2]
Love you every day girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time

[Chorus]
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, girl
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Just like I need you

I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Love you every day girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
