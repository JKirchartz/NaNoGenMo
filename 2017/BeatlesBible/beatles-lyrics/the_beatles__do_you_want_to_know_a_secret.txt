[Intro]
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?, whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?, whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you love to hear
I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
I've known the secret for a week or two
Nobody knows, just we two

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?, whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you love to hear
I'm in love with you
