[Verse]
It feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you oooo oooo

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight, tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you oooo oooo

[Chorus]
Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now, feels so right now

[Pre-Chorus]
