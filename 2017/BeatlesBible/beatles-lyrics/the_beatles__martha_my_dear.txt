[Chorus 1]
Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please, remember me
Martha my love
Don't forget me
Martha my dear

[Chorus 2]
Hold your head up you silly girl
Look what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Verse]
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl

[Chorus 2]
Hold your hand out you silly girl
See what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Chorus 1]
Martha my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha my love
Don't forget me Martha my dear
