You say it's your birthday
It's my birthday too, yeah
They say it's your birthday
We're going to have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you

Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party

[Chorus 2] [x2]
I would like you to dance (Birthday)
Take a cha-cha-cha-chance (Birthday)
I would like you to dance (Birthday)
Dance

[Chorus]
You say it's your birthday
Well it's my birthday too, yeah
You say it's your birthday
We're going to have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you
