[Chorus]
Boy, you gotta carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitation
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you gotta carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Transition]
