[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

[Verse 2]
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Verse 3]
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be. It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Chorus]
All you need is love (All together now)
All you need is love (Everybody)
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
(Yesterday)
(Oh yeah)
(She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yesterday)
