[Instrumental Break]
[Intro]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

[Verse 1]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Instrumental Break]

(pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa)

[Bridge]
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

[Hook]
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

[Outro]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Instrumental Break]
