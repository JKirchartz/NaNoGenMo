[Intro]
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad, misery
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's going to be a drag, misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

[Verse 2]
Send her back to me
Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Send her back to me
Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (oh oh oh)
In misery (ooh ee ooh ooh)
My misery (la la la la la la)
