[Verse 1] [George Harrison]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

[Verse 3]
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 4]
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there

[Outro]
And I told you there's no one there
