[Incomprehensible]

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Verse 2]
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Chorus]
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Chorus]
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

[Verse 3]
Show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R
