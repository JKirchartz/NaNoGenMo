[Chorus 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Chorus 2]
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

[Chorus 3]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
