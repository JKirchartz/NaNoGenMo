[Chorus 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Chorus 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

[Chorus 3]
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and died

[Chorus 1]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm, believe me darling

[Chorus 2]
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well you know I nearly fell down and died

[Chorus 3]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down, believe me darling
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
