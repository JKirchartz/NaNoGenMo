[Instrument break]

[Verse 1]
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Verse 2]
I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

[Chorus]
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter
Tighter

[Verse 3]
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me (please)
Hold me (squeeze)
Hold me
Hold me

[Outro]
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me
