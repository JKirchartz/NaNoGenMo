[Verse 1]
I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Verse 2]
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free
When I was around

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Bridge]
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

[Verse 1 (Alt)]
I think I'm going to be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Bridge]
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

[Verse 2]
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free
When I was around

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

[Outro]
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
