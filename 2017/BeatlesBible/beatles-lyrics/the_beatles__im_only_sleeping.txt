[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse  1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
