[Verse 1]
Since she's been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame
It's plain to see

So go away and leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe
That she would leave
Me on my own
It's just not right
Where every night
I'm all alone

[Hook]
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

[Verse 2]
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Pre-Chorus]
But till she's here
Please don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Until that the day

[Chorus]
Don't come around leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Hook]

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
