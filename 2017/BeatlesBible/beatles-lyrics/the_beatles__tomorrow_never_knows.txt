[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Verse 7]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
