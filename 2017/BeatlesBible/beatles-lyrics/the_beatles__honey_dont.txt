[Verse 1]
Well how come you say you will when you won't
Say you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know honey how you feel
Tell the truth now, is love real?
But ah ah well honey don't, well honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't

[Verse 2]
Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet
But ah ah well honey don't, honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't

[Verse 3]
Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Ah ah baby, been stepping around
But ah ah well honey don't, I said honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
(Ah rock on George, for Ringo one time)

[Outro]
Well honey don't, well honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
