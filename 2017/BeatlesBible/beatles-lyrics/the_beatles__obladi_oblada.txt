[Verse 1]
Desmond has his barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Verse 2]
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (ring!)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing!)

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Chorus 2]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Chorus 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Chorus 2]
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha ha ha ha ha)

[Chorus 3]
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

[Chorus 1]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on

[Outro]
And if you want some fun
Take Ob-La-Di-la-da
