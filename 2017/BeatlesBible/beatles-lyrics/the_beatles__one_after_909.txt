[Chorus 1]
My baby says she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Chorus 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

[Verse]
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]

[Chorus 1]
