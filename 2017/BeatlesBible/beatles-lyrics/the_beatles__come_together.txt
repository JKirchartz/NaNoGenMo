[Interlude]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 1]
Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 2]
He wear no shoeshine, he's got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Verse 3]
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He's got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me
Right!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Ugh!

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
