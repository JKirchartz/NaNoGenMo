[Verse 1]
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I don't just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Verse 2]
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Cos you like me too much and I like you

[Chorus]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 3]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cause I could't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me cause it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Chorus]
Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 4]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cause I could't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me Cause it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
Cause you like me too much and I like you
