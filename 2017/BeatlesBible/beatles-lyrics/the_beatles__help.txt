[Segue]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, going to try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, going to try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, going to try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge]
Do you need anybody
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love

[Chorus]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, going to try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
