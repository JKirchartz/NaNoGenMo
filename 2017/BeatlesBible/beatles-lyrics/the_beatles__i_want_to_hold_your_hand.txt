[Chorus 1]
Oh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Verse 1]
Oh please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
I'll let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Bridge]
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand

[Bridge]
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

[Chorus 3]
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
