[Verse 1]
Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

[Verse 2]
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

[Chorus]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me, if you're lonely you can talk to me

[Break]
Yeah hey, oh!
Ho, ho!
Yeah!
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho!

[Verse 3]
Max (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Wahoo woof! Woof!

Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!

[Verse 5]
Hey man, what's that noise?
Woof!
What d'you say?
I said woof!
D'you know anymore?
Wooaah ha ha ha!
You've got it, that's great! That's right! That's it, man, hoo!
Give it to me, man, hurry! I've got ten children, ho!
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
OK

[Outro]
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
