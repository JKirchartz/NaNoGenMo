[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di

[Chorus]
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

[Verse 3]
I have never known the likes of this
I've been alone, and I have missed
Things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n'da-da'n'da

[Chorus 2x]
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da

[Chorus 2x]
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
Falling, yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin'
Me back again
