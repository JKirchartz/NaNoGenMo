[Verse 1]
Whenever I want you around yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah that's all I got to do

And when I, I want to kiss you yeah
All I got to do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissin you

[Chorus]
And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here yes I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on me

[Verse 2]
And when I, I want to  kiss you, yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come runnin home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do

[Chorus]
