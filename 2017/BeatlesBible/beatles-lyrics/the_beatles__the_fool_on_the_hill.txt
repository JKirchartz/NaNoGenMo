[Verse 1]
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

{Bridge}

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Ooh, ooh
Round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ooh
Round and round and round

Y
