[Verse 1]
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man
Love you like no other baby
Like no other can
Love you like no other baby
Like no other can

[Chorus]
I want to be your man, I want to be your man
I want to be your man, I want to be your man

[Verse 2]
Tell me that you love me baby
Let me understand
Tell me that you love me baby
I want to be your man
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man

[Chorus]
I want to be your man, I want to be your man
I want to be your man, I want to be your man

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
