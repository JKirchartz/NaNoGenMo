[Verse 1]
Born a poor young country boy--Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

[Verse 2]
Sit beside a mountain stream--see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

[Verse 3]
Find me in my field of grass--Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

[Outro]
Mother Nature's son
