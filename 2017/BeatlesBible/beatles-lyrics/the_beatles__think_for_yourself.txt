[Verse 1]
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 2]
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Because I won't be there with you

[Verse 3]
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you

[Outro]
Think for yourself
Cause I won't be there with you
