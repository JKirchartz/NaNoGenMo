[Verse]
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the lie, I saw the lie
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to see your face

[Chorus]
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
Because I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
Because you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Refrain]
If I were you, I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
Because I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
Because you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place


[Outro]
No reply, no reply
