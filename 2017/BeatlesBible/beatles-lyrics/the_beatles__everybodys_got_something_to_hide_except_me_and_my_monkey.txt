Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on is such a joy, come on it's such a joy
Come on and take it easy, come on and take it easy, take it easy, take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide, except for me and my monkey

Hah, the deeper you go, the higher you fly, the higher you fly, the deeper you go
So come on, come on, come on it's such a joy, come on is such a joy
Come on and make it easy, come on and make it easy, take it easy, take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide, except for me and my monkey

Your inside is out, and your outside is in
Your outside is in, and you inside is out
So come on, ha, come on, ha, come on is such a joy
Come on it's such a joy, come on and make it easy, come on and make it easy
Take it easy, take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey

Come on, come on, come on, come on
