[Verse 1]
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
That makes "The News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
G'day!
