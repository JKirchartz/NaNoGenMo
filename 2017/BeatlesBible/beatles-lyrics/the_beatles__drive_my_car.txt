[Verse 1]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I want to be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm going to be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 2]
I told that girl that my prospects were good
She said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

Beep beep'm beep beep yeah

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 3]
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen babe I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

[Chorus]
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Outro]
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
