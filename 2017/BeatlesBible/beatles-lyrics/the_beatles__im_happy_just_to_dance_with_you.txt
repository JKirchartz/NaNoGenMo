[Intro]
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 1]
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Chorus]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Because I'm happy just to dance with you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
Because I'm happy just to dance with you
