[Chorus 1]
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

[Chorus 2]
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now

Well half past nine, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Went out last night, I didn't stay late
Before I got home I had nineteen dates

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
