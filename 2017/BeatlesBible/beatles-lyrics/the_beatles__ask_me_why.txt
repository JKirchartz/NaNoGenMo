[Verse 1]
I love you, because you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry
It's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Verse 2]
I love you, because you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
