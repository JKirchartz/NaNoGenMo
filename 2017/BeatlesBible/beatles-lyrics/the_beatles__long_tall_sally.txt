[Verse]
I'm going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he had to miss it but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby
Yeeeeh baby
Woooooh baby
Having me some fun tonight

I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby
Yeeeeh baby
Woooooh baby
Having me some fun tonight

Well long tall Sally built pretty sweet
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby
Yeeeeh baby
Woooooh baby
Having me some fun tonight

[Chorus] [x2]
We're going to have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun, yeah yeah yeah
