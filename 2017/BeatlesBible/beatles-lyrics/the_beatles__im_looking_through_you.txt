[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Chorus]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 2]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Chorus]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah
Oh baby I'm changed
Ah I'm looking through you
Yeah I'm looking through you
