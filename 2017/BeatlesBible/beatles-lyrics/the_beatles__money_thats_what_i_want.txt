[Verse 1]
The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees
Now give me money
That's what I want
That's what I want, yeah
That's what I want

Your loving gives me a thrill
But your loving don't pay my bills
Now give me money
That's what I want
That's what I want, yeah
That's what I want

[Chorus] [x2]
Money don't get everything it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money
That's what I want
That's what I want, yeah
That's what I want, wah

[Verse 2]
Well now give me money
A lot of money
Wow, yeah, I want to be free
Oh I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want, well
Now give me money
A lot of money
Wow, yeah, you need money
Now, give me money
That's what I want, yeah
That's what I want
