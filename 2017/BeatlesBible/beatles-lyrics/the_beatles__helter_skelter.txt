[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn
And I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer!
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Go Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Helter Skelter
Yeah

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer!
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

[Bridge]
Look out!
'Cause here she comes

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn
And I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Well do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

[Hook]
Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Look out!
Helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes she is
Yes she is
Coming down fast

[Breakdown]

[Ringo]
I got blisters on my fingers!
