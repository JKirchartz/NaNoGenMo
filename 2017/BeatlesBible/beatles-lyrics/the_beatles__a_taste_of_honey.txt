[Intro]
A taste of honey! Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Verse 1]
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey! Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Chorus]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

[Verse 2]
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey! Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Chorus]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you
