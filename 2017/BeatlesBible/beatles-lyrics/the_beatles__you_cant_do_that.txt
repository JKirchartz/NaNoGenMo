[Verse]
I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, You can’t do that

Well it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, You can’t do that

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's green
Because I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seeeen
You talking that way, They'd laugh in my face

[Chorus]
So Please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh You can’t do that!

[Bridge]
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
