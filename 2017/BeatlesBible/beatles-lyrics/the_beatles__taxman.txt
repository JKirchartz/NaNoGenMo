Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me

Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all

Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

[Verse 3]
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet

[Hook]
Taxman
Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman

[Verse 4]
Don't ask me what I want it for (Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more (Haha, Mr. Heath)

Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 5]
Now my advice for those who die (Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes (Taxman!)

And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)
