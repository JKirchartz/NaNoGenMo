<p> DIGITIZE THE WORLD. (A new life awaits you). TECHNOLOGY is speeding ahead:DIGITIZE THE WORLD. (A new life awaits you). TECHNOLOGY is speeding ahead:<br> 
        are you following the integrated golden horizons?<br> 
        Take technology apart and see what it really is!<br> 
        Reuse everything!<br> 
        Make sculpture out of polystyrene, computers, plastic, metal, anything!<br> 
        Become a techno junky. Wear technology!<br> 
        ANYONE can make or be art. Exhibit on the street.<br> 
        Exhibit on yourself. Glue your piece to Alan Bond's front door!<br> 
        Right of access to all data.<br> 
        Graffiti artists: start cyber-tagging. <br> 
        DON'T be rude: talk to your fax machine.<br> 
        Work things out for yourself, go beyond current standards and values and<br> 
        make<br> 
        your own.<br> 
        Master computers and you will have hacking power over banks, governments,<br> 
        and the military through technology.<br> 
        Psychoactive designer foods.<br> 
        Subversive cultures are starting to seep from the rotten foundations of<br> 
        our society - cut their hydraulic lines.<br> 
        Civilization destroys the world so lets digitize it and save the entire<br> 
        human<br> 
        society on mainframe laser disk. <br> 
        All humans and the junk they produce will be sealed inside a huge<br> 
        computer.<br> 
      </p>
	  
<p> Forget the meat of your bodies. Full-on brain experiences await you inside<br> 
        a computer. Even have sex with a computer. <br> 
        Interface!<br> 
        Your true life and aspirations are inhibited by the weak flesh of your <br> 
        body - your body is a burden. It is simply meat. Wetware can enhance it.<br> 
        Cyborg implants bring you closer to true experience. <br> 
        Jack in to neuro-circuits. Once all people, objects, senses, and<br> 
        experiences<br> 
        are digitized onto laser disk (with backup copies) the real world can<br> 
        finally breathe a sign of relief as man has disappeared forever.<br> 
        He has already tried to create his own environment, now the potential is <br> 
        here!<br> 
        Organic life is no longer a valid lifestyle. Fully synthesized<br> 
        environments<br> 
        where all physical and emotional feelings can be chemically simulated.<br> 
        Soon it will be possible to inject a biological computer to program<br> 
        your brain, extend your life, anything.<br> 
        This is your future.<br> 
        You are your consciousness, don't let a physical existence fool you.<br> 
        Physical bodies are now superseded, replace your body with machine<br> 
        and computer components. And become superhuman!<br> 
        Self sufficient society, solar powered.<br> 
        We can now venture to the limits of the cosmos because we are not bound<br> 
        by earthly dimensions. Cybernetics does not discriminate by looks, race,<br> 
        disabilities, sex, species because it is pure brain to brain<br> 
        communication.<br> 
        Jack in your neurons to complete expression and communication to self.<br> 
        Be free of disease, food, be totally efficient. Learn technology.<br> 
        Moder man's aesthetic is grounded in pre 20th century decorativeness and<br> 
        over indulgent art theorising.<br> 
        The new aesthetic is computer generated CYBER DADA.<br> 
        The new species are cyborgs, man/machines, precise superior flawless<br> 
        beings to house our consciousness and create a new world.<br> 
        DON'T BE AFRAID : LEARN TECHNOLOGY : DON'T BE AFRAID.<br> 
        By wearing circuitry you will represent the new age.<br> 
        Take electronics apart and see what they are.<br> 
        Learn electronics, computer programming : the arts of the future.<br> 
        Don't be intimidated by flashing lights and buzzing, and computers<br> 
        that look like microwave ovens!<br> 
        Master technology so it wont beat you as it rapidly fills the world.<br> 
        Technology controls the world so if you control technology...<br> 
        The end of the world is coming, but it is the beginning of a perfect<br> 
        techno world. STOP reviving old cultures - HAVE NEW ONES!!!<br> 
        The youth of today have become complacent and apathetic, easily controlled<br> 
        by advertising, the media, and unscrupulous governments.<br> 
        Let the top of hierarchy know that they can't use technology to control<br> 
        us, but that we are fully integrated with technology and it is ours.<br> 
        Digitize the world!!! <br> 
        It's time to interface with technology and understand it. <br> 
        KNOW IT personally.<br> 
        Get TECH. out of the establishment and into the streets.<br> 
        Dive in CYBERSPACE where all feelings and physical realities can be<br> 
        psycho-chemically simulated. <br> 
        DON'T BE AFRAID : EXPOSE YOUR CIRCUITRY. <br> 
        COME TO TERMS WITH TODAY'S MATERIALS.<br> 
        The future will come whether you like it or not so be ready for it.<br> 
        PAINTING HAS DIED AGAIN : stop using purely old materials like oil and<br> 
        canvas.<br> 
        It will not last in a cyber world.<br> 
        (WHICH WILL COME WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT).<br> 
        <br> 
        Art, life, and the world are becoming increasingly meaningless so<br> 
        -------------------&gt; <br> 
        <br> 
        CYBER DADA IS POPULAR CULTURE, IT'S TODAY'S SOCIETY,<br> 
        AND IT'S FUTURE! <br> 
        <br>
