<p>BOUSHBOU IS DADA; DADA IS NOT BOUSHBOU</p>

<p>a document of quiet things, clacking things: wet things, sleeping things. Walls and fingers thereof.
<br>or
<br>A thesis against the laws of civility or excitement.
<br>For sublimity maybe and only
</p>

<br>Bring down the doctor; he is sick with the hoof!
<br>Smoke sandwiches for the kings and queens
<br>And intellectual disaffectionates
<br>Crisp the reactionaries, 4'
<br>Theres polkadots in our roots ; hitting the strum ... and locate the boring attitudes
<br>Reling quished. Bring down the antique smiles and nods . build up a new face
<br>rivers wrinkles washing dimples tasking fibs
<br>bring down the overhead lights lasping
<br>a lapid lake top a' head whisping
<br>8.) two pyramid structures in modern architecture, lightning made by spoilers commence!
<br>language made by gentlemen of the law cracked under foot...feet!
<br>boring authors of this, shudder and weep lowse hoof!

<p>document of fruit in mouth, 1993</p>

<p>document: a tank, untitled... long days into the sun (wherever dreamt or spat) mechanical</p>

<p>moreso: factories off the main road. Could be a holiday thing, gags and motels. Passionate ropes.</p>

<p>the great legend and myth of the musician responsible for sounds: ah, fet, zo, w.. ; Plucked dull.
<br>Germany in the 14th century, France in the 5th. Poland in the 19th century, Russian in the 8th. A great castle and then a great flood.
<br>Lost the instrument, began to fly again. Dreamt in fevers yet drove in carriages within horses, within towers and kites. The titles of the pieces.. also dreamt.
<br>Eight and then eight and then four and then six. Nine and then eight and then six and then three.
</p>

<p>document for being, real and touchable suitcases</p>

<p>document for dreaming loss and dreaming leaking feathers and grey skin</p>

<p>sounds found within mouth, like words. Ribbon sha! Ribbon</p>

<p>fragile branches and bumps, sweet salty and moist</p>

<p>arguments for culture ; a saloon for new awakenings, leaves and toy boxes</p>

<p>in the garden; roots and being tired. lock lock lock lock</p>

<p>day one: such</p>

<p>day two: such 2</p>

<p>day three: such 3 - 60 years</p>

<br>Flies tempting grass
<br>Number 8 (boar)
<br>Ka / End game sum
</p>

<p>it was nice of you to find my ear-fish and paddles, I almost forgot that I lost the most intimate screeching of my wallet. Walls feeding peanuts. UUU UUU UUU UUU UUU UUU UUU.</p>
