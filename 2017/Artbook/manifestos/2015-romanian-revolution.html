<p>Here is the story of my beloved country.</p>

<p>I am Romanian, proud to be so! I love my mountains and my friends and family!</p>

<p>This is the story of a country that has been robbed of everything: its past, present and future.</p>

<p>The story of a country that has all the natural resources: gold, oil, fields of rich land for agriculture, the Danube filled with fish, one quarter of the country covered in century-old forest.</p> 

<p>This is the story of a country that has the human resources: top mathematicians, doctors, poliglots.</p>

<p>The country where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C4%83rt%C4%83ria_tablets" target="_blank">first writing in the world</a> was discovered.</p>

<p>The country where the latin language was born, the country that is now acknowledged by every respectable historian as the cradle of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgmKrGSJVnU" target="_blank">European civilisation.</a> 

<p>This is the sotry of a country and a nation that has been robbed of its past and identity.</p>

<p>In the last 25 years everything was sold and destroyed, our factories, our gold, our oil. Corruption grew and grew and it became a way of life, from the tiny to the huge: everywhere you go you have to bribe someone! From the school secretaries who will not stamp your student licence (that gives you 50% off on all public transport) if you do not bring coffee and flowers, to the top officials and heads of state.</p>

<p>As the population became more and more angry they started protesting. The answer of our officials was: Who doesn't like it here is free to go! The result: 20% fewer doctors in 5 years... all our highly qualified brains have left, because they were invited to leave the country from our heads of state.</p>

<p>Others with college degrees went abroad to Italy and Spain to pick strawberries and send money home to thier families to survive. There is a whole generation that will come after us of children who grew up without parents. A psychologically damaged generation of children who grew up alone or raised by relatives.</p>

<p>They robbed our identity, invited everyone who spoke against the system to leave the country and crushed the spirit of our nation.</p>

<p>Our future: no doctors, no engineers, no parents and no hope.<p>

<p>This is the result of the last 25 years. No past, no present, no future!</p>

<p>&quot;The day we give up is the day we die&quot;</p>

<p>The people in the streets are my generation. A generation of experiments! Our grandparents fought in World War II, our parents made a revolution in '89. Now my generation woke up!<p>

<p>And we demand that our brothers and sisters come back home and the politicians leave instead. We demand our honour and identity back.<p>

<p>Romania is a bomb ticking!</p>

<p>This is just the beginning of my generation's revolution!</p>
