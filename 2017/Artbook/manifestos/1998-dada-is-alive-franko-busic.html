<p>Finally, all of you, the masses of flesh and obedient slaves, subjective or objective, with no difference, you can feel the effect of tiding up modern arts on the Balkans. Every possibility of creative expression has been prohibited or at least made senseless because of general financial ignorance, useless because it is unprofitable. But when social-political conditions push creative art to the senseless, <strong>DADA</strong> is born. This is how I raise my own individual rebellion. I'm announcing rebirth of <strong>DADA</strong>, and I'm spitting on your impotent &quot;art&quot; of national, regional or religious &quot;values&quot;.</p>

<p>Like Tristan Tzara, I find myself very nice.</p>

<p>It is time for <strong>DADA</strong>! <strong>DADA</strong> is born! Long live <strong>DADA</strong>! Death to <strong>DADA</strong>! <strong>DADA</strong> is God! Fuck the <strong>DADA</strong>! Those, whose voices will be the loads against <strong>DADA</strong>, they are actually, in their own stupidity, the greatest supporters of <strong>DADA</strong>. They give her sense, life, they confirm the value of her fight. <strong>DADA</strong> is senselessness. <strong>DADA</strong> is CHAOS. <strong>DADA</strong> doesn't appear like certain political direction with aim to expose or remove from power. <strong>DADA</strong> has no political connotation; <strong>DADA</strong> has no political ambitions. <strong>DADA</strong> is not against any particular political direction. <strong>DADA</strong> IS AGAINST EVERYBODY! <strong>DADA</strong> IS COMPLETE DESTRUCTION! Those who will, like me, decide for <strong>DADA</strong>, those who know to tell you: No, we don't have idealistic approach suitable to neosatanist, who justify their behaviour explaining that they are big creator's kids who are destroying old to make new, the one who makes/changes by destroying... We don't want to create anything. We are destroying just to destroy. We are destroying 'cause we've been pushed to senselessness and we are trying to get out of it by destroying. Nothing can be changed. This is the end. And changing the flag won't save you. We don't have ideology and you cannot adjust to us. We are even between ourselves against one another. Long live <strong>DADA</strong>! Death to <strong>DADA</strong>! We are destroying to destroy. We are destroying 'cause we are enjoying destroying. We tread by treading, we will trample you down by treading: You and your impotent &quot;art&quot; with national, regional or religious &quot;values&quot;.</p>

<p>Like Tristan Tzara I still find myself very nice.</p>

<p>Although in her senseless/sense and in her contradiction/diction, <strong>DADA</strong> is always original. <strong>DADA</strong> can't stand repeating, so even this manifesto is not <strong>DADA</strong>ist. It is against <strong>DADA</strong>, but also it is for <strong>DADA</strong>. <strong>DADA</strong> is eternal originality of destruction and provocation. You can't repeat <strong>DADA</strong>. Everyone, who would again expose pissoirs calling them fountains, or recite poetry with no existing words, that person is no <strong>DADA</strong>ist. He is called Repeating. He is commercialising and glorifying the senseless in senselessness. So, that's why I spit on your impotent &quot;art&quot; with national, regional of religious &quot;values&quot;.</p>

<p>I really find myself nice.</p>

<p>FUCKFUCK PUCPUC BUMBUM DUMDUM FUCKFUCK PUCPUC BUMBUM DUMDUM FUCKFUCK PUCPUC BUMBUM DUMDUM <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> <strong>DADA</strong> I spit onyour impotent&quot;art&quot; with national, regional or religious &quot;values&quot;.</p>

<p>Like any other <strong>DADA</strong>ist manifesto, this one is unfinished as well. I'm leaving it to the strength of your destructive imagination.</p>

<p>Franko Busic, May 1998</p>
