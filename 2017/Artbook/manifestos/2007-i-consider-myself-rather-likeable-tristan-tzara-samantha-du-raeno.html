<p>I sleep very late. I commit suicide at 65&#37;. My life is very cheap, it's only 30&#37; of life for me. My life has 30&#37; of life. It lacks arms, strings and a few buttons. 5&#37; is devoted to a state of semi-lucid stupor accompanied by anaemic crackling. This 5&#37; is called DADA. So life is cheap. Death is a bit more expensive. But life is charming and death is equally charming.
A few days ago I was at a meeting of imbeciles. There were a lot of people there. Everyone was charming. Tristan Tzara, a small, absurd and insignificant individual was giving a lecture on the art of becoming charming. He was charming, at that. Everyone is charming. And witty. It's delightful, isn't it? Everyone is delightful, at that. 9 degrees below zero. It's charming, isn't it? No, it isn't charming. God isn't up to it. He isn't even in the directory. But even so he's charming.</p>

<p>Ambassadors, poets, counts, princes, musicians, journalists, actors, writers, diplomats, directors, dressmakers, socialists, princesses and baronesses are charming.</p>

<p>You're all of you charming, very subtle, witty and delightful. 10100ristan 10100zara says 10100o you: he's qui10100e willing 10100o do some10100hing else, bu10100 he prefers 10100o remain an idio10100, a prac10100ical joker and a hoaxer.
