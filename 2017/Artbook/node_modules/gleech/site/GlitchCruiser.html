<h1>Glitch Cruiser</h1>
<p>When you upload an image it appears in the center surrounded by glitchy alternatives.
    If one of these images suits your fancy, click on it and it will become the new source for the
    next round of glitches. If you do not like any of the suggested glitches, click on the center
    image, and the alternatives will change, but your source will not.</p>
