We had stayed up all night, my friends and I, under hanging mosque lamps with domes of filigreed brass, domes starred like our spirits, shining like them with the prisoned radiance of electric hearts, For hours we had trampled our atavistic ennui into rich oriental rugs, arguing up to the last confines of logic and blackening many reams of paper with our frenzied scribbling,An immense pride was buoying us up, because we felt ourselves alone at that hour, alone, awake, and on our feet, like proud beacons or forward sentries against an army of hostile stars glaring down at us from their celestial encampments, Alone with stokers feeding the hellish fires of great ships, alone with the black spectres who grope in the red-hot bellies of locomotives launched on their crazy courses, alone with drunkards reeling like wounded birds along the city walls,Suddenly we jumped, hearing the mighty noise of the huge double-decker trams that rumbled by outside, ablaze with colored lights, like villages on holiday suddenly struck and uprooted by the flooding Po and dragged over falls and through gourges to the sea,Then the silence deepened, But, as we listened to the old canal muttering its feeble prayers and the creaking bones of sickly palaces above their damp green beards, under the windows we suddenly heard the famished roar of automobiles,“Let's go,” I said, “Friends, away, Let's go, Mythology and the Mystic Ideal are defeated at last, We're about to see the Centaur's birth and, soon after, the first flight of Angels, We must shake at the gates of life, test the bolts and hinges, Let's go, Look there, on the earth, the very first dawn, There's nothing to match the splendor of the sun's red sword, slashing for the first time through our millennial gloom,”We went up to the three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on their torrid breasts, I stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier, but revived at once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that threatened my stomach,The raging broom of madness swept us out of ourselves and drove us through streets as rough and deep as the beds of torrents, Here and there, sick lamplight through window glass taught us to distrust the deceitful mathematics of our perishing eyes,I cried, “The scent, the scent alone is enough for our beasts,”And like young lions we ran after Death, its dark pelt blotched with pale crosses as it escaped down the vast violet living and throbbing sky,But we had no ideal Mistress raising her divine form to the clouds, nor any cruel Queen to whom to offer our bodies, twisted like Byzantine rings, There was nothing to make us wish for death, unless the wish to be free at last from the weight of our courage,And on we raced, hurling watchdogs against doorsteps, curling them under our burning tires like collars under a flatiron, Death, domesticated, met me at every turn, gracefully holding out a paw, or once in a while hunkering down, making velvety caressing eyes at me from every puddle,“Let's break out of the horrible shell of wisdom and throw ourselves like pride-ripened fruit into the wide, contorted mouth of the wind, Let's give ourselves utterly to the Unknown, not in desperation but only to replenish the deep wells of the Absurd,”The words were scarcely out of my mouth when I spun my car around with the frenzy of a dog trying to bite its tail, and there, suddenly, were two cyclists coming towards me, shaking their fists, wobbling like two equally convincing but nevertheless contradictory arguments, Their stupid dilemma was blocking my way—Damn, Ouch, I stopped short and to my disgust rolled over into a ditch with my wheels in the air,O maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water, Fair factory drain, I gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black beast of my Sudanese nurse, When I came up—torn, filthy, and stinking—from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart,A crowd of fishermen with handlines and gouty naturalists were already swarming around the prodigy, With patient, loving care those people rigged a tall derrick and iron grapnels to fish out my car, like a big beached shark, Up it came from the ditch, slowly, leaving in the bottom, like scales, its heavy framework of good sense and its soft upholstery of comfort,They thought it was dead, my beautiful shark, but a caress from me was enough to revive it; and there it was, alive again, running on its powerful fins,And so, faces smeared with good factory muck—plastered with metallic waste, with senseless sweat, with celestial soot—we, bruised, our arms in slings, but unafraid, declared our high intentions to all the living of the earth:It is from Italy that we launch through the world this violently upsetting incendiary manifesto of ours, With it, today, we establish Futurism, because we want to free this land from its smelly gangrene of professors, archaeologists, ciceroni and antiquarians, For too long has Italy been a dealer in second-hand clothes, We mean to free her from the numberless museums that cover her like so many graveyards,Museums: cemeteries, Identical, surely, in the sinister promiscuity of so many bodies unknown to one another, Museums: public dormitories where one lies forever beside hated or unknown beings, Museums: absurd abattoirs of painters and sculptors ferociously slaughtering each other with color-blows and line-blows, the length of the fought-over walls,That one should make an annual pilgrimage, just as one goes to the graveyard on All Souls' Day—that I grant, That once a year one should leave a floral tribute beneath the Gioconda, I grant you that, But I don't admit that our sorrows, our fragile courage, our morbid restlessness should be given a daily conducted tour through the museums, Why poison ourselves, Why rot,And what is there to see in an old picture except the laborious contortions of an artist throwing himself against the barriers that thwart his desire to express his dream completely, Admiring an old picture is the same as pouring our sensibility into a funerary urn instead of hurtling it far off, in violent spasms of action and creation,Do you, then, wish to waste all your best powers in this eternal and futile worship of the past, from which you emerge fatally exhausted, shrunken, beaten down,In truth I tell you that daily visits to museums, libraries, and academies (cemeteries of empty exertion, Calvaries of crucified dreams, registries of aborted beginnings,) are, for artists, as damaging as the prolonged supervision by parents of certain young people drunk with their talent and their ambitious wills, When the future is barred to them, the admirable past may be a solace for the ills of the moribund, the sickly, the prisoner, But we want no part of it, the past, we the young and strong Futurists,So let them come, the gay incendiaries with charred fingers, Here they are, Here they are, Come on, set fire to the library shelves, Turn aside the canals to flood the museums, Oh, the joy of seeing the glorious old canvases bobbing adrift on those waters, discolored and shredded, Take up your pickaxes, your axes and hammers and wreck, wreck the venerable cities, pitilessly,The oldest of us is thirty: so we have at least a decade for finishing our work, When we are forty, other younger and stronger men will probably throw us in the wastebasket like useless manuscripts—we want it to happen,They will come against us, our successors, will come from far away, from every quarter, dancing to the winged cadence of their first songs, flexing the hooked claws of predators, sniffing doglike at the academy doors the strong odor of our decaying minds, which will have already been promised to the literary catacombs,But we won't be there, At last they'll find us—one winter's night—in open country, beneath a sad roof drummed by a monotonous rain, They'll see us crouched beside our trembling aeroplanes in the act of warming our hands at the poor little blaze that our books of today will give out when they take fire from the flight of our images,They'll storm around us, panting with scorn and anguish, and all of them, exasperated by our proud daring, will hurtle to kill us, driven by a hatred the more implacable the more their hearts will be drunk with love and admiration for us,Injustice, strong and sane, will break out radiantly in their eyes,Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice,The oldest of us is thirty: even so we have already scattered treasures, a thousand treasures of force, love, courage, astuteness, and raw will-power; have thrown them impatiently away, with fury, carelessly, unhesitatingly, breathless, and unresting, Look at us, We are still untired, Our hearts know no weariness because they are fed with fire, hatred, and speed, Does that amaze you, It should, because you can never remember having lived, Erect on the summit of the world, once again we hurl our defiance at the stars,You have objections,—Enough, Enough, We know them, We've understood, Our fine deceitful intelligence tells us that we are the revival and extension of our ancestors—Perhaps, If only it were so,—But who cares, We don't want to understand, Woe to anyone who says those infamous words to us again,Lift up your heads,Erect on the summit of the world, once again we hurl defiance to the stars,This translation/encoding by www,unknown,nu/futurism/manifesto,htmlSee also The Futurist Manifesto (2009 AD[/HD] remix) by F,T, Marinetti and babel, 20th February 2009TO THE YOUNG ARTISTS OF ITALY,The cry of rebellion which we utter associates our ideals with those of the Futurist poets, These ideals were not invented by some aesthetic clique, They are an expression of a violent desire which boils in the veins of every creative artist today,We will fight with all our might the fanatical, senseless and snobbish religion of the past, a religion encouraged by the vicious existence of museums, We rebel against that spineless worshipping of old canvases, old statues and old bric-a-brac, against everything which is filthy and worm-ridden and corroded by time, We consider the habitual contempt for everything which is young, new and burning with life to be unjust and even criminal,Comrades, we tell you now that the triumphant progress of science makes profound changes in humanity inevitable, changes which are hacking an abyss between those docile slaves of past tradition and us free moderns, who are confident in the radiant splendor of our future,We are sickened by the foul laziness of artists, who, ever since the sixteenth century, have endlessly exploited the glories of the ancient Romans,In the eyes of other countries, Italy is still a land of the dead, a vast Pompeii, whit with sepulchres, But Italy is being reborn, Its political resurgence will be followed by a cultural resurgence, In the land inhabited by the illiterate peasant, schools will be set up; in the land where doing nothing in the sun was the only available profession, millions of machines are already roaring; in the land where traditional aesthetics reigned supreme, new flights of artistic inspiration are emerging and dazzling the world with their brilliance,Living art draws its life from the surrounding environment, Our forebears drew their artistic inspiration from a religious atmosphere which fed their souls; in the same way we must breathe in the tangible miracles of contemporary life — the iron network of speedy communications which envelops the earth, the transatlantic liners, the dreadnoughts, those marvelous flights which furrow our skies, the profound courage of our submarine navigators and the spasmodic struggle to conquer the unknown, How can we remain insensible to the frenetic life of our great cities and to the exciting new psychology of night-life; the feverish figures of the bon viveur, the cocette, the apache and the absinthe drinker,We will also play our part in this crucial revival of aesthetic expression: we declare war on all artists and all institutions which insist on hiding behind a façade of false modernity, while they are actually ensnared by tradition, academicism and, above all, a nauseating cerebral laziness,We condemn as insulting to youth the acclamations of a revolting rabble for the sickening reflowering of a pathetic kind of classicism in Rome; the neurasthenic cultivation of hermaphroditic archaism which they rave about in Florence; the pedestrian, half-blind handiwork of '48 which they are buying in Milan; the work of pensioned-off government clerks which they think the world of in Turin; the hotchpotch of encrusted rubbish of a group of fossilized alchemists which they are worshipping in Venice, We are going to rise up against all superficiality and banality — all the slovenly and facile commercialism which makes the work of most of our highly respected artists throughout Italy worthy of our deepest contempt,Away then with hired restorers of antiquated incrustations, Away with affected archaeologists with their chronic necrophilia, Down with the critics, those complacent pimps, Down with gouty academics and drunken, ignorant professors,Ask these priests of a veritable religious cult, these guardians of old aesthetic laws, where we can go and see the works of Giovanni Segantini today, Ask them why the officials of the Commission have never heard of the existence of Gaetano Previati, Ask them where they can see Medardo Rosso's sculpture, or who takes the slightest interest in artists who have not yet had twenty years of struggle and suffering behind them, but are still producing works destined to honor their fatherland,These paid critics have other interests to defend, Exhibitions, competitions, superficial and never disinterested criticism, condemn Italian art to the ignominy of true prostitution,And what about our esteemed 'specialists', Throw them all out, Finish them off, The Portraitists, the Genre Painters, the Lake Painters, the Mountain Painters, We have put up with enough from these impotent painters of country holidays,Down with all marble-chippers who are cluttering up our squares and profaning our cemeteries, Down with the speculators and their reinforced-concrete buildings, Down with laborious decorators, phoney ceramicists, sold-out poster painters and shoddy, idiodic illustrators,These are our final CONCLUSIONS:With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we will:The dead shall be buried in the earth's deepest bowels, The threshold of the future will be swept free of mummies, Make room for youth, for violence, for daring,This translation by Roberto Brain (Apollonio, Umbro, ed, Documents of 20th Century Art: Futurist Manifestos, Brain, Robert, R,W, Flint, J,C, Higgitt, and Caroline Tisdall, trans, New York: Viking Press, 1973, 24-27,)See also: Manifesto of the Futurist Programmers, 1991It could be said that the only display of the art of colors currently in use is the painting, A painting is a medley of colors placed in reciprocal relationships in order to represent an idea, (You will note that I have defined painting as the art of color, For brevity’s sake, I will not concern myself with line, an element taken from another art,) A new and more rudimentary form of pictorial art can be created by placing masses of color harmoniously arranged in relationship to each other over a surface, so as to give pleasure to the eye without representing any image, This would correspond to what in music is known as harmony, and we can therefore call it chromatic harmony, These two forms of art, chromatic harmony and the painting, are spatial; music tells us of the existence of something essentially different, the mingling of chromatic tones presented to the eye successively, a motif of colors, a chromatic theme, I shall not, since it is not yet necessary, go on to speak of a fourth form of art, corresponding to musical drama, which would give rise to chromatic drama, Consequently, two years ago, after the entire theory had been minutely established, we decided to make a serious attempt to create a music of colors, We immediately began to think of the instruments, which perhaps did not exist, and which we would have to have made to order, to enable us to realize these theories, We traveled untrodden roads, letting intuition guide us for the most part, but always proceeding concurrently, in order not to be led astray, with our study of the physics of light and sound, the works of Tyndall and of many others, Naturally we applied and exploited the laws of parallelism between the arts which had already been determined, For two months each studied on his own without communicating his results—afterwards we presented, discussed and amalgamated our observations, This confirmed our idea, which had anyway preceded our study of physics, of adhering to music and transferring the tempered scale of music into the field of color, We knew, however, that the chromatic scale consists of only one octave, and that, on the other hand, the eye, unlike the ear, does not possess the power of resolution (although, rethinking this point, I realize that one must have reservations), Yet we felt the obvious need of a subdivision of the solar spectrum, even an artificial and arbitrary one (since the effect stems principally from the relationships between the colors that impress the eye), Consequently we selected four equally distanced gradations in each color, We had four reds chosen at equal distances in the spectrum, four greens, four violets, etc, In this way we managed to extend the seven colors in four octaves, After the violet of the first octave came the red of the second, and so on, To translate all this into practice we naturally used a series of twenty-eight colored electric light bulbs, corresponding to twenty-eight keys, Each bulb was fitted with an oblong reflector: the first experiments were done with direct light, and in the subsequent ones a sheet of ground glass was placed in front of the light bulb, The keyboard was exactly like that of a piano (but was less extensive), When an octave was played, for example, the two colors were mingled, as are two sounds on the piano,This chromatic piano, when it was tried out, gave quite good results, so much so that at first we were under the illusion that we had resolved the problem definitively, We amused ourselves by finding all sorts of chromatic mixtures, we composed a few color sonatinas—notturni in violet and mattinate in green, We translated, with a few necessary modifications, a Venetian barcarolle by Mendelssohn, a rondo by Chopin, a Mozart sonata, But at last, after three months of experimentation, we had to confess that with these means no further progress could be made, We obtained the most graceful effects, it is true, but never to the extent that we felt fully gripped, We had at our disposition only twenty-eight tones, the fusions did not work well, the sources of light were not strong enough, if we used powerful bulbs the excessive heat made them discolor in a few days, and then we had to recolor them exactly, with considerable loss of time, We felt very clearly that, in order to obtain the large orchestral effects which alone can convince the masses, we needed to have a truly stupefying intensity of light at our disposition—only then could we emerge from the restricted field of scientific experiment to enter directly into its practice,We turned our thoughts to cinematography, and it seemed to us that this medium, slightly modified, would give excellent results, since its light potency was the strongest one could desire, The other problem concerning the need to have hundreds of colors at our disposition was also resolved, since, by exploiting the phenomenon of the persistence of an image on the retina, we would indeed have been able to make many colors merge, in our eye, into a single hue, To achieve this it was sufficient to pass all the component colors in front of the lens in less than a tenth of a second, In this way with a simple cinematographic instrument, with a machine of small dimensions, we would have obtained the innumerable and extremely powerful effects of large musical orchestras, the true chromatic symphony, This was the theory, In practice, the results, after we had acquired the camera, procured many hundreds of meters of film, removed the gelatin and applied the color were, as always, mixed, To achieve a harmonious, gradual and uniform sequence of chromatic themes we had removed the rotating switch and had managed to get rid of the shutter action, too; but this was exactly the reason for the failure of the experiment, and meant that in place of the expected marvelous harmony there exploded over the screen a cataclysm of incomprehensible colors, It was only subsequently that we understood the reason, We replaced all the parts we had removed, and decided to consider the film to be colored as divided into bars, each one as long as the space between four perforations, which corresponds at least in films of the Pathe gauge, to one complete rotation of the switch, We prepared another length of film and tried again, The fusion of the colors was perfect, and that was the important factor, As for the effect, it was not all that good, but we had already realized that where this was concerned we could not reasonably expect much, unless one had the ability, acquired only by long experience, to mentally project on to the screen the development of a motive as it is gradually applied with the brush on to the celluloid, This ability implies the mental fusion of many colors into one single color, and the dissection of a hue into all its components,At this point, seeing that our experiences had got us positively on a solid road, we felt it necessary to pause to effect every possible improvement on the machine we were using, The projector remained unchanged, We merely replaced the arc lamp we had used until then with another arc lamp three times as strong, We made repeated experiments with the screen, using a simple white canvas, a white canvas soaked in glycerin a tinfoil surface, a canvas covered with an impasto that resulted, by reflection, in a sort of phosphorescence, an approximately cubical cage of very fine gauze penetrable by the light rays, which gave a fluctuating effect of clouds of white smoke, At last we returned to a white canvas stretched over a wall, All furniture was removed and the entire room, walls, ceiling and floor, painted white, During the rehearsals we wore white shrouding drapes (incidentally: once chromatic music is established, be it our works or those of others, a fashion will follow encouraging the well-dressed spectator to go to the theater of color dressed in white, Tailors can get to work on it now), To date we have not been able to achieve better results, and we have continued to work in our white room, which, in any case, serves us quite adequately,Before describing, since I cannot do otherwise, the most recent successful color symphonies, I will attempt to give the reader some idea of this, though it will be far from the effect of the encounter of colors extended in time, I will place under the reader’s eyes a few sketches (here to hand) for a film planned long since, This will precede public performances, accompanied by suitable explanations, (It will consist of fifteen or so extremely simple chromatic motives, each about a minute long and each divided from the next, These will serve to communicate to the public the legitimacy of chromatic music, to help it grasp its mechanisms and put it in the right frame of mind to enjoy the color symphony which will follow, simple at first, then little by little more complex,) To hand I have three chromatic themes sketched in on strips of celluloid, The first is the simplest one could imagine, It has two colors only, complementaries, red and green, To begin with the whole screen is green, then in the center a small red six-pointed star appears, This rotates on itself, the points vibrating like tentacles and enlarges, enlarges until it fills the whole screen, The entire screen is red, and then unexpectedly a nervous rash of green spots breaks out all over it, These grow until they absorb all the red and the entire canvas is green, This lasts a minute, The second theme has three colors—pale blue, white and yellow, In a blue field two lines, one yellow, one white, move, bend together, detach themselves and curl up, Then they undulate towards each other and intertwine, This is an example of a linear, as well as chromatic, theme, The third is composed of seven colors, the seven colors of the solar spectrum in the form of small cubes arranged initially on a horizontal line at the bottom of the screen against a black background, These move in small jerks, grouping together, crashing against each other, shattering and reforming, diminishing and enlarging, forming columns and lines, interpenetrating, deforming, etc,And now it only remains for me to inform the reader of our most recent experiments, These are two films, both of about two hundred meters, The first is entitled The Rainbow, The colors of the rainbow constitute the dominant theme, which appears occasionally in different forms and with ever-increasing intensity until it finally explodes with dazzling violence, The screen is initially grey, then in this grey background there gradually appears a very slight agitation of radiant tremors which seem to rise out of the grey depths, like bubbles in a spring, and when they reach the surface they explode and disappear, The entire symphony is based on this effect of contrast between the cloudy grey of the background and the rainbow, and the struggle between them, The struggle increases, the spectrum, suffocated beneath the ever blacker vortices which roll from background to foreground, manages to free itself, flashes, then disappears again to reappear more intensely close to the frame, Finally, in an unexpected dusty disintegration, the grey crumbles and the spectrum triumphs in a whirling of catherine-wheels which disappear in their turn, buried under an avalanche of colors, The second is called The Dance, the predominant colors being carmine, violet and yellow, which are continually united, separated and hurled upwards in an agile pirouetting of spinning tops,I have done, There is no point in writing any more, since I could never succeed in giving more than the vaguest idea of color, One can only imagine it for oneself,All one can do is open the way and I think I have done this, a little, I would like to add some comments about chromatic drama, with which we have made some interesting experiments, but this would be going too far, Perhaps I will deal with them in another article on the music of colors which I hope, together with this, will prepare the public to judge serenely the sonatas they will soon see in the theater,Are there people in Italy who are seriously interested in these things, If so, let them write to me and I will have great pleasure in communicating to them all (and it is a great deal) that I have not been able to write and which will smooth the path,To the readers of our New First Unexpected,We alone are the face of our Time, Through us the horn of time blows in the art of the word,The past is too tight, The Academy and Pushkin are less intelligible than hieroglyphics,Throw Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc,, etc, overboard from the Ship of Modernity,He who does not forget his first love will not recognize his last,Who, trustingly, would turn his last love toward Balmont's perfumed lechery, Is this the reflection of today's virile soul,Who, faintheartedly, would fear tearing from warrior Bryusov's black tuxedo the paper armorplate, Or does the dawn of unknown beauties shine from it,Wash Your hands which have touched the filthy slime of the books written by those countless Leonid Andreyevs,All those Maxim Gorkys, Kuprins, Bloks, Sologubs, Remizovs, Averchenkos, Chornys, Kuzmins, Bunins, etc, need only a dacha on the river, Such is the reward fate gives tailors,From the heights of skyscrapers we gaze at their insignificance,We order that the poets' rights be revered: And if for the time being the filthy stigmas of Your "Common sense" and "good taste" are still present in our lines, these same lines for the first time already glimmer with the Summer Lightening of the New Coming Beauty of the Self-sufficient (self-centered) Word,David Burliuk, Alexander Kruchenykh, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Victor KhlevnikovA reply to those dishonest journalists who twist phrases to make the Idea seem ridiculous; to those women who only think what I have dared to say; to those for whom Lust is still nothing but a sin; to all those who in Lust can only see Vice, just as in Pride they see only vanity, Lust, when viewed without moral preconceptions and as an essential part of life’s dynamism, is a force,Lust is not, any more than pride, a mortal sin for the race that is strong, Lust, like pride, is a virtue that urges one on, a powerful source of energy,Lust is the expression of a being projected beyond itself, It is the painful joy of wounded flesh, the joyous pain of a flowering, And whatever secrets unite these beings, it is a union of flesh, It is the sensory and sensual synthesis that leads to the greatest liberation of spirit, It is the communion of a particle of humanity with all the sensuality of the earth,Lust is the quest of the flesh for the unknown, just as Celebration is the spirit’s quest for the unknown, Lust is the act of creating, it is Creation,Flesh creates in the way that the spirit creates, In the eyes of the Universe their creation is equal, One is not superior to the other and creation of the spirit depends on that of the flesh,We possess body and spirit, To curb one and develop the other shows weakness and is wrong, A strong man must realize his full carnal and spiritual potentiality, The satisfaction of their lust is the conquerors’ due, After a battle in which men have died, it is normal for the victors, proven in war, to turn to rape in the conquered land, so that life may be re-created,When they have fought their battles, soldiers seek sensual pleasures, in which their constantly battling energies can be unwound and renewed, The modern hero, the hero in any field, experiences the same desire and the same pleasure, The artist, that great universal medium, has the same need, And the exaltation of the initiates of those religions still sufficiently new to contain a tempting element of the unknown, is no more than sensuality diverted spiritually towards a sacred female image,Art and war are the great manifestations of sensuality; lust is their flower, A people exclusively spiritual or a people exclusively carnal would be condemned to the same decadence – sterility,Lust excites energy and releases strength, Pitilessly it drove primitive man to victory, for the pride of bearing back a woman the spoils of the defeated, Today it drives the great men of business who run the banks, the press and international trade to increase their wealth by creating centers, harnessing energies and exalting the crowds, to worship and glorify with it the object of their lust, These men, tired but strong, find time for lust, the principal motive force of their action and of the reactions caused by their actions affecting multitudes and worlds,Even among the new peoples where sensuality has not yet been released or acknowledged, and who are neither primitive brutes nor the sophisticated representatives of the old civilizations, woman is equally the great galvanizing principle to which all is offered, The secret cult that man has for her is only the unconscious drive of a lust as yet barely woken, Amongst these peoples as amongst the peoples of the north, but for different reasons, lust is almost exclusively concerned with procreation, But lust, under whatever aspects it shows itself, whether they are considered normal or abnormal, is always the supreme spur,The animal life, the life of energy, the life of the spirit, sometimes demand a respite, And effort for effort’s sake calls inevitably for effort for pleasure’s sake, These efforts are not mutually harmful but complementary, and realize fully the total being,For heroes, for those who create with the spirit, for dominators of all fields, lust is the magnificent exaltation of their strength, For every being it is a motive to surpass oneself with the simple aim of self-selection, of being noticed, chosen, picked out,Christian morality alone, following on from pagan morality, was fatally drawn to consider lust as a weakness, Out of the healthy joy which is the flowering of the flesh in all its power it has made something shameful and to be hidden, a vice to be denied, It has covered it with hypocrisy, and this has made a sin of it,We must stop despising Desire, this attraction at once delicate and brutal between two bodies, of whatever sex, two bodies that want each other, striving for unity, We must stop despising Desire, disguising it in the pitiful clothes of old and sterile sentimentality,It is not lust that disunites, dissolves and annihilates, It is rather the mesmerizing complications of sentimentality, artificial jealousies, words that inebriate and deceive, the rhetoric of parting and eternal fidelities, literary nostalgia – all the histrionics of love,We must get rid of all the ill-omened debris of romanticism, counting daisy petals, moonlight duets, heavy endearments, false hypocritical modesty, When beings are drawn together by a physical attraction, let them – instead of talking only of the fragility of their hearts – dare to express their desires, the inclinations of their bodies, and to anticipate the possibilities of joy and disappointment in their future carnal union,Physical modesty, which varies according to time and place, has only the ephemeral value of a social virtue,We must face up to lust in full conciousness, We must make of it what a sophisticated and intelligent being makes of himself and of his life; we must make lust into a work of art, To allege unwariness or bewilderment in order to explain an act of love is hypocrisy, weakness and stupidity,We should desire a body consciously, like any other thing,Love at first sight, passion or failure to think, must not prompt us to be constantly giving ourselves, nor to take beings, as we are usually inclined to do so due to our inability to see into the future, We must choose intelligently, Directed by our intuition and will, we should compare the feelings and desires of the two partners and avoid uniting and satisfying any that are unable to complement and exalt each other,Equally conciously and with the same guiding will, the joys of this coupling should lead to the climax, should develop its full potential, and should permit to flower all the seeds sown by the merging of two bodies, Lust should be made into a work of art, formed like every work of art, both instinctively and consciously,We must strip lust of all the sentimental veils that disfigure it, These veils were thrown over it out of mere cowardice, because smug sentimentality is so satisfying, Sentimentality is comfortable and therefore demeaning,In one who is young and healthy, when lust clashes with sentimentality, lust is victorious, Sentiment is a creature of fashion, lust is eternal, Lust triumphs, because it is the joyous exaltation that drives one beyond oneself, the delight in posession and domination, the perpetual victory from which the perpetual battle is born anew, the headiest and surest intoxication of conquest, And as this certain conquest is temporary, it must be constantly won anew,Lust is a force, in that it refines the spirit by bringing to white heat the excitement of the flesh, The spirit burns bright and clear from a healthy, strong flesh, purified in the embrace, Only the weak and sick sink into the mire and are diminished, And lust is a force in that it kills the weak and exalts the strong, aiding natural selection,Lust is a force, finally, in that it never leads to the insipidity of the definite and the secure, doled out by soothing sentimentality, Lust is the eternal battle, never finally won, After the fleeting triumph, even during the ephemeral triumph itself, reawakening dissatisfaction spurs a human being, driven by an orgiastic will, to expand and surpass himself,Lust is for the body what an ideal is for the spirit – the magnificent Chimaera, that one ever clutches at but never captures, and which the young and the avid, intoxicated with the vision, pursue without rest,Lust is a force,To begin with, Photodynamism cannot be interpreted as an innovation applicable to photography in the way that chronophotography was, Photodynamism is a creation that aims to achieve ideals that are quite contrary to the objectives of all the representational means of today, If it can be associated at all with photography, cinematography and chronophotography, this is only by virtue of the fact that, like them, it has its origins in the wide field of photographic science, the technical means forming common ground, All are based on the physical properties of the camera,We are certainly not concerned with the aims and characteristics of cinematography and chronophotography, We are not interested in the precise reconstruction of movement, which has already been broken up and analysed, We are involved only in the area of movement which produces sensation, the memory of which still palpitates in our awareness,We despise the precise, mechanical, glacial reproduction of reality, and take the utmost care to avoid it, For us this is a harmful and negative element, whereas for cinematography and chronophotography it is the very essence, They in their turn overlook the trajectory, which for us is the essential value,The question of cinematography in relation to us is absolutely idiotic, and can only be raised by a superficial and imbecilic mentality motivated by the most crass ignorance of our argument,Cinematography does not trace the shape of movement, It subdivides it, without rules, with mechanical arbitrariness, disintegrating and shattering it without any kind of aesthetic concern for rhythm, It is not within its coldly mechanical power to satisfy such concerns,Besides which, cinematography never analyses movement, It shatters it in the frames of the film strip, quite unlike the action of Photodynamism, which analyses movement precisely in its details, And cinematography never synthesises movement, either, It merely reconstructs fragments of reality, already coldly broken up, in the same way as the hand of a chronometer deals with time even though this flows in a continuous and constant stream,Photography too is a quite distinct area; useful in the perfect anatomical reproduction of reality; necessary and precious therefore for aims that are absolutely contrary to ours, which are artistic in themselves, scientific in their researches, but nevertheless always directed towards art,And so both photography and Photodynamism possess their own singular qualities, clearly divided, and are very different in their importance, their usefulness and their aims,Marey's chronophotography, too, being a form of cinematography carried out on a single plate or on a continuous strip of film, even if it does not use frames to divide movement which is already scanned and broken up into instantaneous shots, still shatters the action, The instantaneous images are even further apart, fewer and more autonomous than those of cinematography, so that this too cannot be called analysis,In actual fact, Marey's system is used, for example, in the teaching of gymnastics, And out of the hundred images that trace a man's jump the few that are registered are just sufficient to describe and to teach to the young the principal stages of a jump,But although this may be all very well for the old Marey system, for gymnastics and other such applications, it is not enough for us, With about five extremely rigid instantaneous shots we cannot obtain even the reconstruction of movement, let alone the sensation, Given that chronophotography certainly does not reconstruct movement, or give the sensation of it, any further discussion of the subject would be idle, except that the point is worth stressing, as there are those who, with a certain degree of elegant malice, would identify Photodynamism with chronophotography, just as others insisted on confusing it with cinematography,Marey's system, then, seizes and freezes the action in its principal stages, those which best serve its purpose, It thus describes a theory that could be equally deduced from a series of instantaneous photographs, They could similarly be said to belong to different subjects, since, if a fraction of a stage is removed, no link unites and unifies the various images, They are photographic, contemporaneous, and appear to belong to more than one subject, To put it crudely, chronophotography could be compared with a clock on the face of which only the quarter-hours are marked, cinematography to one on which the minutes too are indicated, and Photodynamism to a third on which are marked not only the seconds, but also the intermovemental fractions existing in the passages between seconds, This becomes an almost infinitesimal calculation of movement,In fact it is only through our researches that it is possible to obtain a vision that is proportionate, in terms of the strength of the images, to the very tempo of their existence, and to the speed with which they have lived in a space and in us,The greater the speed of an action, the less intense and broad win be its trace when registered with Photodynamism, It follows that the slower it moves, the less it will be dematerialised and distorted, The more the image is distorted, the less real it will be, It will be more ideal and lyrical, further extracted from its personality and closer to type, with the same evolutionary effect of distortion as was followed by the Greeks in their search for their type of beauty,There is an obvious difference between the photographic mechanicality of chronophotography -embryonic and rudimentary cinematography - and the tendency of Photodynamism to move away from that mechanicality, following its own ideal, and completely opposed to the aims of all that went before (although we do propose to undertake our own scientific researches into movement),Photodynamism, then, analyses and synthesises movement at will, and to great effect, This is because it does not have to resort to disintegration for observation, but possesses the power to record the continuity of an action in space, to trace in a face, for instance, not only the expression of passing states of mind, as photography and cinematography have never been able to, but also the immediate shifting of volumes that results in the immediate transformation of expression,A shout, a tragical pause, a gesture of terror, the entire scene, the complete external unfolding of the intimate drama, can be expressed in one single work, And this applies not only to the point of departure or that of arrival - nor merely to the intermediary stage, as in chronophotography - but continuously, from beginning to end, because in this way, as we have already said, the intermovemental stages of a movement can also be invoked,In fact, where scientific research into the evolution and modelling of movement are concerned, we declare Photodynarnism to be exhaustive and essential, given that no precise means of analysing a movement exists (we have already partly examined the rudimentary work of chronophotography),And so - just as the study of anatomy has always been essential for an artist - now a knowledge of the paths traced by bodies in action and of their transformation in motion will be indispensable for the painter of movement,In the composition of a painting, the optical effects observed by the artist are not enough, A precise analytical knowledge of the essential properties of the effect, and of its causes, are essential, The artist may know how to synthesise such analyses, but within such a synthesis the skeleton, the precise and almost invisible analytical elements, must exist, These can only be rendered visible by the scientific aspects of Photodynamism,In fact, every vibration is the rhythm of infinite minor vibrations, since every rhythm is built up of an infinite quantity of vibrations, In so far as human knowledge has hitherto conceived and considered movement in its general rhythm, it has fabricated, so to speak, an algebra of movement, This has been considered simple and finite (cf, Spencer: First Principles - The Rhythm of Motion), But Photodynamism has revealed and represented it as complex, raising it to the level of an infinitesimal calculation of movement (see our latest works, e,g, The Carpenter, The Bow, Changing Positions),Indeed, we represent the movement of a pendulum, for example, by relating its speed and its tempo to two orthogonal axes,We will obtain a continuous and infinite sinusoidal curve,But this applies to a theoretical pendulum, an immaterial one, The representation we will obtain from a material pendulum will differ from the theoretical one in that, after a longer or shorter (but always finite) period, it will stop,It should be clear that in both cases the lines representing such movement are continuous, and do not portray the reality of the phenomenon, In reality, these lines should be composed of an infinite number of minor vibrations, introduced by the resistance of the point of union, This does not move with smooth continuity but in a jerky way caused by infinite coefficients, Now, a synthetic representation is more effective, even when its essence envelops an analytically divisionist value, than a synthetic impressionist one (meaning divisionism and impressionism in the philosophical sense), In the same way the representation of realistic movement will be much more effective in synthesis - containing in its essence an analytical divisionist value (e,g, The Carpenter, The Bow, etc,), than in analysis of a superficial nature, that is, when it is not minutely interstatic but expresses itself only in successive static states (e,g, The Typist),Therefore, just as in Seurat's painting the essential question of chromatic divisionism (synthesis of effect and analysis of means) had been suggested by the scientific enquiries of Rood, so today the need for movemental divisionism, that is, synthesis of effect and analysis of means in the painting of movement, is indicated by Photodynamism, But - and this should be carefully noted - this analysis is infinite, profound and sensitive, rather than immediately perceptible,This question has already been raised by demonstrating that, just as anatomy is essential in static reproduction, so the anatomy of an action - intimate analysis - is indispensable in the representation of movement, This will not resort to thirty images of the same object to represent an object in movement, but will render it infinitely multiplied and extended, whilst the figure present will appear diminished,Photodynamism, then, can establish results from positive data in the construction of moving reality, just as photography obtains its own positive results in the sphere of static reality,The artist, in search of the forms and combinations that characterise whatever state of reality interests him, can, by means of Photodynamism, establish a foundation of experience that will facilitate his researches and his intuition when it comes to the dynamic representation of reality, After all, the steady and essential relationships which link the development of any real action with artistic conception are indisputable, and are affirmed independently of formal analogies with reality,Once this essential affinity has been established, not only between artistic conception and the representation of reality, but also between artistic conception and application, it is easy to realise how much information dynamic representation can offer to the artist who is engaged in a profound search for it,In this way fight and movement in general, light acting as movement, and hence the movement of light, are revealed in Photodynamism, Given the transcendental nature of the phenomenon of movement, it is only by means of Photodynamism that the painter can know what happens in the intermovemental states, and become acquainted with the volumes of individual motions, He will be able to analyse these in minute detail, and will come to know the increase in aesthetic value of a flying figure, or its diminution, relative to light and to the dematerialization consequent upon motion, Only with Photodynamism can the artist be in possession of the elements necessary for the construction of a work of art embodying the desired-for synthesis,With reference to this the sculptor Roberto Melli wrote to me explaining that, in his opinion, Photodynamism 'must, in the course of these new researches into movement which are beginning to make a lively impression on the artist's consciousness, take the place which has until now been occupied by drawing, a physical and mechanical phenomenon very different from the physical transcendentalism of Photodynamism, Photodynamism is to drawing what the new aesthetic currents are to the art of the past,' , , ,Now, with cinematography and Marey's equivalent system the viewer moves abruptly from one state to another, and thus is limited to the states that compose the movement, without concern for the intermovemental states of the action; and with photography he sees only one state, But with Photodynamism, remembering what took place between one stage and another, a work is presented that transcends the human condition, becoming a transcendental photograph of movement, For this end we have also envisaged a machine which will render actions visible, more effectively than is now today possible with actions traced from one point, but at the same time keeping them related to the time in which they were made, They will remain idealised by the distortion and by the destruction imposed by the motion and light which translate themselves into trajectories,So it follows that when you tell us that the images contained in our Photodynamic works are unsure and difficult to distinguish, you are merely noting a pure characteristic of Photodynamism, For Photodynamism, it is desirable and correct to record the images in a distorted state, since images themselves are inevitably transformed in movement, Besides this, our aim is to make a determined move away from reality, since cinematography, photography and chronophotography already exist to deal with mechanically precise and cold reproduction,We seek the interior essence of things: pure movement; and we prefer to see everything in motion, since as things are dematerialised in motion they become idealised, while still retaining, deep down, a strong skeleton of truth,This is our aim, and it is by these means that we are attempting to raise photography to the heights which today it strives impotently to attain, being deprived of the elements essential for such an elevation because of the criteria of order that make it conform with the precise reproduction of reality, And then, of course, it is also dominated by that ridiculous and brutal negative element, the instantaneous exposure, which has been presented as a great scientific strength when in fact it is a laughable absurdity,But where the scientific analysis of movement is concerned - that is, in the multiplication of reality for the study of its deformation in motion - we possess not merely one but a whole scale of values applied to an action, We repeat the idea, we insist, we impose and return to it without hesitation and untiringly, until we can affirm it absolutely with the obsessive demonstration of exterior and internal quality which is essential for us,And it is beyond doubt that by way of such multiplication of entities we will achieve a multiplication of values, capable of enriching any fact with a more imposing personality,In this way, if we repeat the principal states of the action, the figure of a dancer - moving a foot, in mid-air, pirouetting - will even when not possessing its own trajectory or offering a dynamic sensation, be much more like a dancer, and much more like dancing, than would a single figure frozen in just one of the states that build up a movement,The picture therefore can be invaded and pervaded by the essence of the subject, It can be obsessed by the subject to the extent that it energetically invades and obsesses the public with its own values, It will not exist as a passive object over which an unconcerned public can take control for its own enjoyment, It will be an active thing that imposes its own extremely free essence on the public, though this will not be graspable with the insipid facility common to all images that are too faithful to ordinary reality,To further this study of reality multiplied in its volumes, and the multiplication of the lyrical plastic sensation of these, we have conceived a method of research, highly original in its mechanical means, which we have already made known to some of our friends,But in any case, at the moment we are studying the trajectory, the synthesis of action, that which exerts a fascination over our senses, the vertiginous lyrical expression of life, the lively invoker of the magnificent dynamic feeling with which the universe incessantly vibrates,We will endeavour to extract not only the aesthetic expression of the motives, but also the inner, sensorial, cerebral and psychic emotions that we feel when an action leaves its superb, unbroken trace,This is in order to offer to others the necessary factors for the reproduction of the desired feeling,And it is on our current researches into the interior of an action that all the emotive artistic values existing in Photodynamism are based,To those who believe that there is no need for such researches to be conducted with photographic means, given that painting exists, we would point out that, although avoiding competing with painting, and working in totally different fields, the means of photographic science are so swift, so fertile, and so powerful in asserting themselves as much more forward looking and much more in sympathy with the evolution of life than all other old means of representation,Plastic dynamism is the simultaneous action of the motion characteristic of an object (its absolute motion), mixed with the transformation which the object undergoes in relation to its mobile and immobile environment (its relative motion), Therefore, it is not true that only the decomposition of an object's shape constitutes dynamism, Certainly decomposition and distortion in themselves have dynamic value, in so far as they break up the continuity of a line, interrupting the rhythm of a silhouette, increasing interactions and indicating possible directions of a shape, But this is not the Futurist concept of plastic dynamism, any more than a trajectory, the sway in a pendulum, or movement from point A to point B,Dynamism is the lyrical conception of forms, interpreted in the infinite manifestations of the relativity between absolute motion and relative motion, between the environment and the object which come together to form the appearance of a whole: environment + object,It is the creation of a new form which expresses the relativity between weight and expansion, between rotation and revolution; here, in fact, we have life itself caught in a form which life has created in its infinite succession of events,It seems clear to me that this succession is not to be found in the repetition of legs, arms and faces, as many people have idiotically believed, but is achieved through the intuitive search for the one single form which produces continuity in space, This is the key to making an object live in universal terms, Therefore, instead of the old-fashioned concept of a sharp differentiation of bodies, instead of the modem concept of the Impressionists with their subdivision and repetition and rough indications of images, we would substitute a concept of dynamic continuity as the only form, And it is not by accident that I say 'form' instead of 'line' since dynamic form is a species of fourth dimension, both in painting and sculpture, which cannot exist perfectly without the complete concurrence of those three dimensions which determine volume: height, width, depth,For sculpture we have tried to break the unity of material into several materials, each one of which serves to characterise, through its own natural diversity, differences in the weight and expansion of molecular volumes, and which together create the initial dynamic element,Attempts to find realist form have always led sculpture and painting further and further away from their origin: architecture, Architecture represents for sculpture what composition does for painting; in fact, the absence of architectural elements is one of the negative characteristics of Impressionist sculpture,However, pre-Impressionist studies of form have inevitably resulted in dead forms and, as a consequence, immobility; and this immobility is one of the main characteristics of Cubist sculpture,Between real and ideal forms, between new forms (Impressionist) and traditional forms (Greek) we have discovered a form which is variable, evolutionary, and quite different from any other concepts which have existed up till now, We Futurists have discovered form in movement, and the movement of form, Only through this dual conception of form can we give a hint of plastic life in our work, without having extracted and removed it from its living environment, which would mean arresting its motion,In sculpture, therefore, we are not necessarily looking for pure form, but for pure plastic rhythm, not the construction of an object, but the construction of an object's action, We have abolished pyramidal architecture to arrive at spiral architecture, A body in movement, therefore, is not simply an immobile body subsequently set in motion, but a truly mobile object, which is a reality quite new and original,With dynamism, then, art climbs to an ideal, superior plane, creating a style and expressing our own age of speed and of simultaneity, When people tell us that the world has examples of both static and moving objects, and that not everything rushes around at speed, we reply that, in our painting it is the conception which dominates the visual, which perceives only fragmentarily, and therefore subdivides, Hence Dynamism is a general law of simultaneity and interpenetration dominating everything, in movement, that is appearance/exception/shading, We have called ourselves 'the primitives of a new and completely transformed sensitivity', This frankly acknowledges a clear view of our creative potential,Since we have to re-create everything anew, we Futurists are forced to make a far greater effort than any other revolutionaries who have appeared on the scene of Art,With us Futurists, for the very first time, a sculptural simultaneity, analogous to pictorial simultaneity, has appeared in art,An architectural construction in spiral form creates for the observer a continuity which allows him to understand, through the force-form, which is derived from real form, a new form defining objects and their driving force,With this we have been able to maintain that power-form expresses the potential of the living form,This unity within a given space provides us with a depth of volume, revealing each profile depth instead of a whole series of motionless profiles as we find in traditional statues,For me, the things I am saying are not crazy abstractions, as many have thought who have laughed inanely at our experiments; instead it is the static qualities of the old masters which are abstractions, and unnatural abstractions at that - they are an outrage, a violation and a separation, a conception far removed from the law of the unity of universal motion, We are not, therefore, anti-nature, as many simpleminded reactionary exponents of realism and naturalism like to think; we are ANTI-ART; in other words we are against the stasis which has reigned for centuries in art, except for a few rare attempts found in the most warm-blooded works and in the liveliest periods,In fact, the static attitudes of Greece and Egypt are much more arbitrary than our ideas of dynamic continuity, It should never be forgotten that we are passing through a stage in a long progress towards interpenetration, simultaneity and fusion, on which humanity has been engaged for thousands of years,As a result, sculpture as well, by means of an interpenetration of planes, is bringing figures alive within their environment without their being mere slaves of artificial or fixed lights or pretty backgrounds, Such methods would destroy architectural laws and as a result the artist would have to run for help to painting, which was one of the fundamental mistakes of Impressionist sculpture,We must, therefore, raise the concept of the object to that of a plastic whole: object + environment, In this way we shall have the object extended into the rays of light which shine on to it, by uniting atmospherical blocks with elements of a more concrete reality,We exhort the young to forget the idea of figures enclosed within a traditional framework - a result of culture, academism and tradition, Instead Futurist sculpture will put the figure at the centre of a plastic orientation of space,We must free ourselves from all the old formulas, We must destroy everything within us which is static, dead, everything in fact which is passéist, I shall never tire of repeating: no painting can exist outside our plastic dynamism,Dynamism in painting and sculpture is, therefore, an evolutional concept of a plastic reality, It is the reflexion of a sensibility which conceives the world as an infinite prolonging of an evolutionary species, This is life itself, We Futurists have been able to create the model form - the form of forms - continuity,Long live the great art vortex sprung up in the centre of this town,We stand for the Reality of the Present – not for the sentimental Future, or the sacripant Past,We want to leave Nature and Men alone,We do not want to make people wear Futurist Patches, or fuss men to take to pink and sky-blue trousers,We are not their wives or tailors,The only way Humanity can help artists is to remain independent and work unconsciously,WE NEED THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANITY – their stupidity, animalism and dreams,We believe in no perfectibility except our own,Intrinsic beauty is in the Interpreter and Seer, not in the object or content,We do not want to change the appearance of the world, because we are not Naturalists, Impressionists or Futurists (the latest form of Impressionism), and do not depend on the appearance of the world for our art,WE ONLY WANT THE WORLD TO LIVE, and to feel it's crude energy flowing through us,It may be said that great artists in England are always revolutionary, just as in France any really fine artist had a strong traditional vein,Blast sets out to be an avenue for all those vivid and violent ideas that could reach the Public in no other way,Blast will be popular, essentially, It will not appeal to any particular class, but to the fundamental and popular instincts in every class and description of people, TO THE INDIVIDUAL, The moment a man feels or realizes himself as an artist, he ceases to belong to any milieu or time, Blast is created for this timeless, fundamental Artist that exists in everybody,The Man in the Street and the Gentleman are equally ignored,Popular art does not mean the art of the poor people, as it is usually supposed to, It means the art of the individuals,Education (art education and general education) tends to destroy the creative instinct, Therefore it is in times when education has been non-existant that art chiefly flourished,But it is nothing to do with "the People,"It is a mere accident that that is the most favourable time for the individual to appear,To make the rich of the community shed their education skin, to destroy politeness, standardization and academic, that is civilized, vision, is the task we have set ourselves,We want to make in England not a popular art, not a revival of lost folk art, or a romantic fostering of such unactual conditions, but to make individuals, wherever found, We will convert the King if possible,A VORTICIST KING, WHY NOT,DO YOU THINK LLOYD GEORGE HAS THE VORTEX IN HIM,MAY WE HOPE FOR ART FROM LADY MOND,We are against the glorification of "the People," as we are against snobbery, It is not necessary to be an outcast bohemian, to be unkempt or poor, any more than it is necessary to be rich or handsome, to be an artist, Art is nothing to do with the coat you wear, A top-hat can well hold the Sixtine, A cheap cap could hide the image of Kephren,AUTOMOBILISM (Marinetteism) bores us, We don't want to go about making a hullo-bulloo about motor cars, anymore than about knives and forks, elephants or gas-pipes,Elephants are VERY BIG, Motor cars go quickly,Wilde gushed twenty years ago about the beauty of machinery, Gissing, in his romantic delight with modern lodging houses was futurist in this sense,The futurist is a sensational and sentimental mixture of the aesthete of 1890 and the realist of 1870,The "Poor" are detestable animals, They are only picturesque and amusing for the sentimentalist or the romantic, The "Rich" are bores without a single exception, en tant que riches ,We want those simple and great people found everywhere,Blast presents an art of Individuals, See also BLAST-UP, by Katy Smith and babel, 2009As we await our much prayed-for great war, we Futurists carry our violent antineutralist action from city square to university and back again, using our art to prepare the Italian sensibility for the great hour of maximum danger, Italy must be fearless, eager, as swift and elastic as a fencer, as indifferent to blows as a boxer, as impassive at the news of a victory that may have cost fifty-thousand dead as at the news of a defeat,For Italy to learn to make up its mind with lightning speed, to hurl itself into battle, to sustain every undertaking and every possible calamity, books and reviews are unnecessary, They interest and concern only a minority, are more or less tedious, obstructive, and relaxing, They cannot help chilling enthusiasm, aborting impulses, and poisoning with doubt a people at war, War--Futurism intensified--obliges us to march and not to rot [marciare, non marcire] in libraries and reading rooms, THEREFORE WE THINK THAT THE ONLY WAY TO INSPIRE ITALY WITH THE WARLIKE SPIRIT TODAY IS THROUGH THE THEATRE, In fact ninety percent of Italians go to the theatre, whereas only ten percent read books and reviews, But what is needed is a FUTURIST THEATRE, completely opposed to the passeist theatre that drags its monotonous, depressing processions around the sleepy Italian stages,Not to dwell on the historical theatre, a sickening genre already abandoned by the passeist public, we condemn the whole contemporary theatre because it is too prolix, analytic, pedantically psychological, explanatory, diluted, finicking, static, as full of prohibitions as a police station, as cut up into cells as a monastery, as moss-grown as an old abandoned house, In other words it is a pacifistic, neutralist theatre, the antithesis of the fierce, overwhelming, synthesizing velocity of the war,Our Futurist Theatre will be:Synthetic, That is, very brief, To compress into a few minutes, into a few words and gestures, innumerable situations, sensibilities, ideas, sensations, facts, and symbols,The writers who wanted to renew the theatre (Ibsen, Maeterlinck, Andreyev, Claudel, Shaw) never thought of arriving at a true synthesis, of freeing themselves from a technique that involves prolixity, meticulous analysis, drawn-out preparation, Before the works of these authors, the audience is in the indignant attitude of a circle of bystanders who swallow their anguish and pity as they watch the slow agony of a horse who has collapsed on the pavement, The sigh of applause that finally breaks out frees the audience's stomach from all the indigestible time it has swallowed, Each act is as painful as having to wait patiently in an antichamber for the minister (coup de theatre: kiss, pistol shot, verbal revelation, etc,) to receive you, All this passeist or semi-Futurist theatre, instead of synthesizing fact and idea in the smallest number of words and gestures, savagely destroys the variety of place (source of dynamism and amazement), stuffs many city squares, landscapes, streets, into the sausage of a single room, For this reason this theatre is entirely static,We are convinced that mechanically, by force of brevity, we can achieve an entirely new theatre perfectly in tune with our swift and laconic Futurist sensibility, Our acts can also be moments [atti-- attimi] only a few seconds long, With this essential and synthetic brevity the theatre can bear and even overcome competition from the cinema,Atechnical, The passeist theatre is the literary form that most distorts and diminishes an author's talent, This form, much more than Iyric poetry or the novel, is subject to the demands of technique: (1) to omit every notion that doesn't conform to public taste; (2) once a theatrical idea has been found (expressible in a few pages), to stretch it out over two, three or four acts; (3) to surround an interesting character with many pointless types: coatholders, door-openers, all sorts of bizarre comic turns; (4) to make the length of each act vary between half and three-quarters of an hour; (5) to construct each act taking care to (a) begin with seven or eight absolutely useless pages, (b) introduce a tenth of your idea in the first act, five-tenths in the second, four-tenths in the third, (c) shape your acts for rising excitement, each act being no more than a preparation for the finale, (d) always make the first act a little boring so that the second can be amusing and the third devouring; (6) to set off every essential line with a hundred or more insignificant preparatory lines; (7) never to devote less than a page to explaining an entrance or an exit minutely; (8) to apply systematically to the whole play the rule of a superficial variety, to the acts, scenes, and lines, For instance, to make one act a day, another an evening, another deep night; to make one act pathetic, another anguished, another sublime; when you have to prolong a dialogue between two actors, make something happen to interrupt it, a falling vase, a passing mandolin player, Or else have the actors constantly move around from sitting to standing, from right to left, and meanwhile vary the dialogue to make it seem as if a bomb might explode outside at any moment (e,g,, the betrayed husband might catch his wife red-handed) when actually nothing is going to explode until the end of the act; (9) to be enormously careful about the verisimilitude of the plot; (10) to write your play in such a manner that the audience understands in the finest detail the how and why of everything that takes place on the stage, above all that it knows by the last act how the protagonists will end up,With our synthesist movement in the theatre, we want to destroy the Technique that from the Greeks until now, instead of simplifying itself, has become more and more dogmatic, stupid, logical, meticulous, pedantic, strangling, THEREFORE:1, It's stupid to write one hundred pages where one would do, only because the audience through habit and infantile instinct wants to see character in a play result from a series of events, wants to fool itself into thinking that the character really exists in order to admire the beauties of Art, meanwhile refusing to acknowledge any art if the author limits himself to sketching out a few of the character's traits,2, It's stupid not to rebel against the prejudice of theatricality when life itself (which consists of actions vastly more awkward, uniform, and predictable than those which unfold in the world of art) is for the most part antitheatrical and even in this offers innumerable possibilities for the stage, EVERYTHING OF ANY VALUE IS THEATRICAL,3, It's stupidto pander to the primitivism of the crowd, which, in the last analysis, wants to see the bad guy lose and the good guy win,4, It's stupid to worry about verisimilitude (absurd because talent and worth have little to do with it),5, It's stupid to want to explain with logical minuteness everything taking place on the stage, when even in life one never grasps an event entirely, in all its causes and consequences, because reality throbs around us, bombards us with squalls of fragments of interconnected events, mortised and tenoned together, confused, mixed up, chaotic, E,g,, it's stupid to act out a contest between two persons always in an orderly, clear, and logical way, since in daily life we nearly always encounter mere flashes of argument made momentary by our modern experience, in a tram, a cafe, a railway station, which remain cinematic in our minds like fragmentary dynamic symphonies of gestures, words, lights, and sounds,6, It's stupid to submit to obligatory crescendi, prepared effects, and postponed climaxes,7, It's stupid to allow one's talent to be burdened with the weight of a technique that anyone (even imbeciles) can acquire by study, practice, and patience,8, IT'S STUPID TO RENOUNCE THE DYNAMIC LEAP IN THE VOID OF TOTAL CREATION, BEYOND THE RANGE OF TERRITORY PREVIOUSLY EXPLORED,Dynamic, simultaneous, That is, born of improvisation, lightning-like intuition, from suggestive and revealing actuality, We believe that a thing is valuable to the extent that it is improvised (hours, minutes, seconds), not extensively prepared (months, years, centuries),We feel an unconquerable repugnance for desk work, a priori, that fails to respect the ambience of the theatre itself, THE GREATER NUMBER OF OUR WORKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE THEATRE, The theatrical ambience is our inexhaustible reservoir of inspirations: the magnetic circular sensation invading our tired brains during morning rehearsal in an empty gilded theatre; an actor's intonation that suggests the possibility of constructing a cluster of paradoxical thoughts on top of it; a movement of scenery that hints at a symphony of lights; an actress' fleshiness that fills our minds with genially full-bodied notions,We overran Italy at the head of a heroic battalion of comedians who imposed on audiences Electricita and other Futurist syntheses (alive yesterday, today surpassed and condemned by u's) that were revolutions imprisoned in auditoriums,--From the Politeama Garibaldi of Palermo to the Dal Verme of Milan, The Italian theatres smoothed the wrinkles in the raging massage of the crowd and rocked with bursts of volcanic laughter, We fraternized with the actors, Then, on sleepless nights in trains, we argued, goading each other to heights of genius to the rhythm of tunnels and stations, Our Futurist theatre jeers at Shakespeare but pays attention to the gossip of actors, is put to sleep by a line from Ibsen but is inspired by red or green reflections from the stalls, WE ACHIEVE AN ABSOLUTE DYNAMISM THROUGH THE INTERPENETRATION OF DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERES AND TIMES, E,g,, whereas in a drama like Piu che L'Amore [D'Annunzio], the important events (for instance, the murder of the gambling house keeper) don't take place on the stage but are narrated with a complete lack of dynamism; in the first act of La Figlia di Jorio D'Annunzio] the events take place against a simple background with no jumps in space or time; and in the Futurist synthesis, Simultaneita, there are two ambiences that interpenetrate and many different times put into action simultaneously,Autonomous, alogical, unreal, The Futurist theatrical synthesis will not be subject to logic, will pay no attention to photography; it will be autonomous, will resemble nothing but itself, although it will take elements from reality and combine them as its whim dictates, Above all, just as the painter and composer discover, scattered through the outside world, a narrower but more intense life, made up of colors, forms, sounds, and noises, the same is true for the man gifted with theatrical sensibility, for whom a specialized reality exists that violently assaults his nerves: it consists of what is called THE THEATRICAL WORLD,THE FUTURIST THEATRE IS BORN OF THE TWO MOST VITAL CURRENTS in the Futurist sensibility, defined in the two manifestoes: "The Variety Theatre" and "Weights, Measures, and Prices of Artistic Genius," which are: (1) our frenzied passion for real, swift, elegant, complicated, cynical, muscular, fugitive, Futurist life, (2) our very modern cerebral definition of art according to which no logic, no tradition, no aesthetic, no technique, no opportunity can be imposed on the artist's natural talent; he must be preoccupied only with creating synthetic expressions of cerebral energy that have THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF NOVELTY,The Futurist theatre will be able to excite its audience, that is make it forget the monotony of daily life, by sweeping it through a labyrinth of sensations imprinted on the most exacerbated originality and combined in unpredictable ways,Every night the Futurist theatre will be a gymnasium to train our race's spirit to the swift, dangerous enthusiasms made necessary by this Futurist year, CONCLUSIONS1, TOTALLY ABOLISH THE TECHNIQUE THAT IS KILLING THE PASSEIST THEATRE,2, DRAMATIZE ALL THE DISCOVERIES (no matter how unlikely, weird, and antitheatrical) THAT OUR TALENT IS DISCOVERING IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS, IN ILL-DEFINED FORCES, IN PURE ABSTRACTION, IN THE PURELY CEREBRAL, THE PURELY FANTASTIC, IN RECORD-SETTING AND BODY-MADNESS (E,g,, Vengono, F, T, Marinetti's first drama of objects, a new vein of theatrical sensibility discovered by Futurism,)3, SYMPHONIZE THE AUDIENCE'S SENSIBILITY BY EXPLORING IT, STIRRING UP ITS LAZIEST LAYERS WITH EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE; ELIMINATE THE PRECONCEPTION OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BY THROWING NETS OF SENSATION BETWEEN STAGE AND AUDIENCE; THE STAGE ACTION WILL INVADE THE ORCHESTRA SEATS, THE AUDIENCE,4, FRATERNIZE WARMLY WITH THE ACTORS WHO ARE AMONG THE FEW THINKERS WHO FLEE FROM EVERY DEFORMING CULTURAL ENTERPRISE,5, ABOLISH THE FARCE, THE VAUDEVILLE, THE SKETCH, THE COMEDY, THE SERIOUS DRAMA, AND TRAGEDY, AND CREATE IN THEIR PLACE THE MANY FORMS OF FUTURIST THEATRE, SUCH AS: LINES WRITTEN IN FREE WORDS, SIMULTANEITY, COMPENETRATION, THE SHORT, ACTED-OUT POEM, THE DRAMATIZED SENSATION, COMIC DIALOGUE, THE NEGATIVE ACT, THE REECHOING LINE, "EXTRA-LOGICAL" DISCUSSION, SYNTHETIC DEFORMATION, THE SCIENTIFIC OUTBURST THAT CLEARS THE AIR,6, THROUGH UNBROKEN CONTACT, CREATE BETWEEN US AND THE CROWD A CURRENT OF CONFIDENCE RATHER THAN RESPECTFULNESS, IN ORDER TO INSTILL IN OUR AUDIENCES THE DYNAMIC VIVACITY OF A NEW FUTURIST THEATRICALITY,These are the first words on the theatre, Our first eleven theatrical syntheses (by Marinetti, Settimelli, Bruno Corra, R, Chiti, Balilla Pratella) were victoriously imposed on crowded theatres in Ancona, Bologna, Padua, Naples, Venice, Verona, Florence, and Rome, by Ettore Berti, Zoncada, and Petrolini, In Milan we soon shall have the great metal building, enlivened by all the electromechanical inventions, which alone will permit us to realize our most free conceptions on the stage, The PlaysUMBERTO BOCCIONIBachelor Apartment / La GarconniereTHEATRICAL SYNTHESISIdiotic interior of an elegant youth's bachelor apartment--prints on the walls, a very low divan, several vases of flowers, as in all bachelor apartments, A newly-acquired painting is in front of the divan on an easel,THE YOUTH (listening eagerly near the door): Here we are, (Opens it,) Good morning, How are you,THE WOMAN (advancing, with a certain reserve): Good morning, (Looking around her,) It's nice in here,THE YOUTH (with fervor): How beautiful you are, Very elegant, Thank you for coming, I doubted,THE WOMAN: Why, Where is the painting, I came to see it,THE YOUTH: It s this one, (He takes her by the hand and conducts her in front of the painting, While THE WOMAN looks at it squinting, THE YOUTH takes her in his arms and kisses the nape of her neck,)THE WOMAN (struggling energetically): Sir, What are you thinking of, These are really cowardly,THE YOUTH: Excuse me, (He grasps her again forcefully and speaks close to her mouth,) You are very beautiful, You are mine, You must be mine, , ,THE WOMAN (struggling in a way that makes her seem serious): Sir, Leave me alone, I'll call for someone, I am a respectable woman, Leave me alone,THE YOUTH (mortified, letting her go): You are right, I ask your pardon, I don't know what I am doing, I will leave you,THE WOMAN: Open the door for me, I want to get out of here,THE YOUTH (going to open the door): Go,(With this word, THE WOMAN lets her fur coat fall, and appears in black silk panties, with her bosom, shoulders, and arms nude, With coquetry and modesty, she runs to crouch on the divan,)THE WOMAN: You are timid, after all, Turn that painting, and come here, , ,(1)The formal you ("voi") is used throughout this sintesi, instead of the more familiar form,

Well, Let's decide, The first thing is to vote by secret ballot, Let's first vote for the genus of candidate, Then let's vote for the species, or in other words, for the names,USHER: Very distinguished gentlemen, here is a new candidate, He asserts that the announcement of the contest did not have a category for the presentation of titles; and since he comes from far away and was unable to hasten his steps,1ST MEMBER: Ah, for a Futurist, ,USHER: Thus, he asks to be admitted equally to the contest,2ND MEMBER: And the titles,USHER: He says he will present them himself, in

springs up suddenly when an elongated body posses rapidly in front of the window going upward from below, Shouting, he leans out the window and looks up, Meanwhile, he hears his doorbell ring, He runs

the third floor,FIRST-FLOOR TENANT (arriving) : I have gone crazy, or the super-natural is present, Something passed in front of my window on the first floor, a solid, hairy body that rose dizzily,FOURTH-FLOOR TENANT (entering terrified and clinging to the furniture): Me too, I saw it also, But it seemed to me like a soft body, like liquid,FIRST-FLOOR TENANT: But no, It was long and hairy,THIRD-FLOOR TENANT: No, No, No, I assure you, It was evanescent like a gas,SECOND-FLOOR TENANT: The concierge would have seen it, , call him,THE OTHERS (in chorus): Yes, Yes, Let s call him, Concierge, , Concierge,(THE CONCIERGE enters,)ALL THE TENANTS (with great confusion'): Have you seen it, Have you seen it, What rose from the street,THE CONCIERGE (calm, with a smile of compassion): Calm yourselves, Calm yourselves, It's nothing extraordinary, It is the young woman on the fifth floor who every day sucks up her lover with her glance, of course, he doesn't go up the stairs, that dirty pig, I maintain the honor of the building,CURTAINUMBERTO BOCCIONIGenius and Culture / Genio e ColturaIn the centre a costly dressing table with a mirror in front of which a very elegant WOMAN, already dressed to leave finishes putting on rouge, At the right a CRITIC, an ambiguous being neither dirty nor clean neither old nor young neutral is sitting at a table overburdened with books and papers on which shines a large paper knife neither modern nor antique, He turns his shoulder to the dressing table, At left the ARTIST, an elegant youth searches in a large file sitting on thick cushions on the floor,THE ARTIST (leaving the file and with his head between his hands): It's terrible, (Pause,) I must get out of here, To be renewed, (He gets up tearing the abstract designs from the file with convulsive hands,) Liberation, These empty forms, worn out, Everything is fragmentary, weak, Oh, Art, who, who will help me, (He looks around; continues to tear up the designs with sorrowful and convulsive motions,)(THE WOMAN is very near him but doesn't hear him, The CRITIC becomes annoyed but not very and going near her takes a book with a yellow jacket,)THE CRITIC (half-asking the WOMAN, and half-talking to himself): But what's the matter with that clown that he acts and shouts that way,THE WOMAN (without looking): Oh well, he is an artist, he wants to renew himself, and he hasn't a cent, THE CRITIC (bewildered): Strange, An artist, Impossible, For twenty years I have profoundly studied this marvelous phenomenon, but I can't recognize it, (Obviously with archeological curiosity,) That one is crazy, Or a protester, He wants to change, But creation is a serene thing, A work of art is done naturally, in silence, and in recollection, like a nightingale sings, Spirit, in the sense that Hegel means spirit,THE WOMAN (intrigued): And if you know how it is done, why don't you tell him, Poor thing, He is distressed,THE CRITIC (strutting): For centuries, the critic has told the artist how to make a work of art, Since ethics and aesthetics are functions of the spirit,THE WOMAN: But you, you've never made any,THE CRITIC (nonplused): Me, Not me,THE WOMAN (laughing with malice): Well, then, you know how to do it, but you don't do it, You are neutral, How boring you must be in bed, (She continues putting on her rouge,)THE ARTIST (always walking back and forth sorrowfully wringing his hands): Glory, Ah, Glory, (Tightening his fists,) I am strong, I am young, I can face anything, Oh, Divine electric lights, sun, To electrify the crowds, Burn them, Dominate them,THE WOMAN (looking at him with sympathy and compulsion): Poor thing, Without any money,THE ARTIST (struck): Ah, I am wounded, I can't resist any longer, (Toward the WOMAN, who doesn't hear him,) Oh, A woman, (Toward the CRITIC, who has already taken and returned a good many books and who leafs through them and cuts them,) You, You, sir, who are a man, listen, Help me,THE CRITIC: Calm down, let's realize the differences, I am not a man, I am a critic, I am a man of culture, The artist is a man, a slave, a baby, therefore, he makes mistakes, I don't see myself as being like him, In him nature is chaos, The critic and history are between nature and the artist, History is history, in other words subjective fact, that is to say fact, in other words history, Anyway it is itself objective,(At these words the ARTIST, who has listened in a stupor falls on the cushions as if struck by lightning, The CRITIC, unaware of this turns and goes slowly to the table to consult his books,)THE WOMAN (getting up dumbfounded): My God, That poor youth is dying, (She kneels in front of the ARTIST and caresses him kindly,)THE ARTIST (reviving): Oh, Signora, Thank you, Oh, Love, maybe love, (Revives more and more,) How beautiful you are, Listen, Listen to me, If you know what a terrible thing the struggle is without love, I want to love, understand,THE WOMAN (pulling away from him): My friend, I understand you, but now I haven't time, I must go out, I am expected by my friend, It is dangerous, He is a man , that is to say, he has a secure position,THE CRITIC (very embarrassed): What's going on, I don't understand anything,THE WOMAN (irritated): Shut up, idiot, You don't understand anything, Come, Help me to lift him, We must cut this knot that is choking his throat,THE CRITIC (very embarrassed): Just a minute,(He carefully lays down the books and puts the others aside on the chair,) Hegel, Kant, Hartmann, Spinoza,THE WOMAN (goes near the youth, crying irritably): Run, come here, help me to unfasten it,THE CRITIC (nonplused): What are you saying,THE WOMAN: Come over here, Are you afraid, Hurry, back here there is an artist who is dying because of an ideal,THE CRITIC (coming closer with extreme prudence): But one never knows, An impulse, a passion, without control, without culture, in short, I prefer him dead, The artist must be, (He stumbles, and falls clumsily on the ARTIST, stabbing his neck with the paper knife,)THE WOMAN (screaming and getting up): Idiot, Assassin, You have killed him, You are red with blood,THE CRITIC (getting up, still more clumsily: I, Signora, How, I don't understand, Red, Red, Yours is a case of color blindness,THE WOMAN: Enough, Enough, (Returns to her dressing table,) It is late, I must go, (Leaving,) Poor youth, He was different and likable, (Exits,)THE CRITIC: I can't find my bearings, (Looks attentively and long at the dead ARTIST,) Oh my God, He is dead, (Going over to look at him,) The artist is really dead, Ah, he is breathing, I will make a monograph, (He goes slowly to his table, From a case, he takes a beard a meter long and applies it to his chin, He puts on his glasses, takes paper and pencil, then looks among his books without finding anything, He is irritated for the first time and pounds his fists, shouting,) Aesthetics, Aesthetics, Where is Aesthetics, (Finding it, he passionately holds a large volume to his chest,) Ah, Here it is, (Skipping, he goes to crouch like a raven near the dead ARTIST, He looks at the body, and writes, talking in a loud voice,) Toward 1915, a marvelous artist blossomed, (He takes a tape measure from his pocket and measures the body,) Like all the great ones, he was 1,68 [meters] tall, and his width, (While he talks, the curtain falls)PAOLO BUZZIParallelepiped / ParallelepipedoTHEATRICAL SYNTHESISAn empty room, On the floor, a mattress in a parallelepiped form, On one side, a taut curtain,LADY IN BLACK (enters accompanied by a POET, occupant of the room): But let's understand each other, I am not a woman who comes to a young man's bachelor apartment, I am a curious intellectual coming to see the house of an enigmatic poet,POET: Good heavens, of course, It's natural,LADY (looking around her): Where do you write,POET: On the floor,LADY: Where do you eat,POET: On the floor,LADY (looking at the mattress): And you sleep on the floor, very simple, but what a bizarre form your bed has,POET: Parallelepiped,LADY (noticing the curtain): And behind that curtain, the toilet,POET: Furniture,LADY (with surprise, ironically): You have furniture,POET: Parallelepiped, (He pulls the curtain back; a straight, rigid, upright bier can be seen, He opens the cover by the hinges like a door of a closet, Inside one sees a hat, coat, and a pair of pants hanging up, and a pair of shoes at the bottom,) As long as I stay on my feet, it also stays on its feet, When I sleep, I use only the bottom: it's soft, as you can see, (Points to the mattress,)LADY: You are right, It is a very bizarre thing, and this mattress,POET: Deliciously soft,LADY: Wool, Moss,POET: Hair, Woman's hair, The hair of all my women,LADY: You don't say, You plucked them well, your little hens,POET (with sudden ardor, hugs the LADY around her waist): I have been waiting for the day to pluck an eagle,LADY (in an imperial manner): Stop there, I am the one who will pluck you, (Goes to close the door,) Now, you must do everything that I want, (Leads him near the upright bier, from which she takes the hat, coat, pants, and shoes)POET: Command,LADY (as if exercising a hypnotic power over the man): Carry it,(He places the bier horizontally on the floor,)POET: And then,LADY: And then, thus, (She makes him put the mattress in the bier,)POET: And then,LADY: And then, I AM DEATH, So let's hear no more, You must get in there,POET (with a last glimmer of hope): With you,LADY: You will see,(The man gets in the bier and falls as if struck, The woman closes the lid, turns the key, and puts it in her pocket, leaving silently,)FRANCESCO CANGIULLOThe Lady-Killer and the Four Seasons / ll Donnaiuolo e le 4 StagioniSYNTHESIS OF TWENTY YEARS OF LOVE(I am sorry but I absolutely cannot give the names of the characters--and it is also necessary to forbid the actor-manager to give them,)Neutral stage--side and back entrances--three seconds after the curtain rises a SCHOOLGIRL in uniform enters from the left, reading a small book, Month of Mary [A missal and appointment book], With her eyes on the book, she comes slowly forward to the stage apron, A sacred picture falls from the pages, With great simplicity she picks it up and places it back between the pages, She begins to read again, remains in front of the footlights until the end,After ten seconds, a BATHER enters from the rear, Of course she is in a swimming suit; blue trunks, sailor's blouse, Wearing a life jacket, the BATHER swims until the end always in a circumscribed space reserved for her on the stage,After ten seconds a WIDOW also enters from the back, bringing in a tomb furnished with a wreath and lighted church candles, Arranging it with the back almost in the right corner, she kneels and bows her head and remains motionless like someone who is being photographed at length from behind,After ten seconds, a BRIDE enters from the right, with her face hidden in a bent arm, She is dressed in white satin, with a long veil, and a garland of orange flowers around her head, Timidly she comes forward to the apron and remains there until the end,After twenty seconds, a very chic LADY-KILLER bursts in from the back with great ease, smoking a cigarette, Nimbly and very selfconfidentIy he throws himself on the edge of the stage apron, spreads his arms out with great openness to the audience, encases his head in his upper arms (the actor will remember Renato Simoni at the fourth curtain call) and, with a diplomatic smile, he fixes the whole audience with a sweeping and precise glance--then says:Voila,and agilely draws back electrically on his toes, C U R T A I N FRANCESCO CANGIULLOThe Paunch of the Vase / La Pancia del VasoTHEATRICAL SYNTHESISAct IThe laboratory of a scientist, In the middle, a cluttered table on which a glass vase is seen, Seated at the table, the SCIENTIST, with the eyes of an idiot, mummified, looks through the paunch of the vase, Immobility of the surroundings, After three minutes--CURTAINAct 2Repeat Act 1 identically,Act 3Like the first and second acts, except shot: a minute after the curtain rises, I come out, with a cudgel, I split the head of the SCIENTIST who, very coldly, without losing his composure, his eyes still staring at the paunch of the glass vase, says to me:SCIENTIST: Would you please leave me your visiting card,(I throw it on the table, light a cigarette, and exit,) (A minute later, without hurrying, the SCIENTIST rings a bell,)(TYPIST appears,)SCIENTIST (always intent): Sew up my head and wrap it up well,(TYPIST takes the materials, disinfects them, sews, wraps his big head until she covers his eyes,)SCIENTIST (hasn't moved): Sit down, write,(TYPIST sitting at the typewriter,)SCIENTIST (looks as best he can at the visiting card; then says, turning to the glass vase): Signor Francesco Cangiullo, paragraph, Sirignano district, comma, Naples, Italy, in parenthesis, Dear Sir, comma, and paragraph, Italians, comma, especially Neapolitans, comma, are always very generous, period, Therefore, comma, I will be eternally grateful for this, comma, dear sir, comma, that you split my head rather than the glass vase, period and paragraph, With regards, comma, your,(TYPIST takes the letter to be signed,)(SCIENTIST looks at it with

THEATRECHARACTERA BULLETRoad at night, cold, deserted,A minute of silence,--A gunshot,CURTAINDada is a new tendency in art, One can tell this from the fact that until now nobody knew anything about it, and tomorrow everyone in Zurich will be talking about it, Dada comes from the dictionary, it is terribly simple, In French it means "hobby horse," In German it means "good-by," "Get off my back," "Be seeing you sometime," In Romanian: "Yes, indeed, you are right, that's it, But of course, yes, definitely, right," And so forth,An international word, Just a word, and the word a movement, Very easy to understand, Quite terribly simple, To make of it an artistic tendency must mean that one is anticipating complications, Dada psychology, dada Germany cum indigestion and fog paroxysm, dada literature, dada bourgeoisie, and yourselves, honored poets, who are always writing with words but never writing the word itself, who are always writing around the actual point, Dada world war without end, dada revolution without beginning, dada, you friends and also-poets, esteemed sirs, manufacturers, and evangelists, Dada Tzara, dada Huelsenbeck, dada m'dada, dada m'dada dada mhm, dada dere dada, dada Hue, dada Tza,How does one achieve eternal bliss, By saying dada, How does one become famous, By saying dada, With a noble gesture and delicate propriety, Till one goes crazy, Till one loses consciousness, How can one get rid of everything that smack of journalism, worms, everything nice and right, blinkered, moralistic, europeanized, enervated, By saying dada, Dada is the world soul, dada is the pawnshop, Dada is the world's best lily-milk soap, Dada Mr, Rubiner, dada Mr, Korrodi, Dada Mr, Anastasius Lilienstein,In plain language: the hospitality of the Swiss is something to be profoundly appreciated, And in questions of aesthetics the key is quality,I shall be reading poems that are meant to dispense with conventional language, no less, and to have done with it, Dada Johann Fuschgang Goethe, Dada Stendhal, Dada Dalai Lama, Buddha, Bible and Nietzsche, Dada m'dada, Dada mhm dada da, It's a question of connections, and of loosening them up a bit to start with, I don't want words that other people have invented, All the words are other people's inventions, I want my own stuff, my own rhythm, and vowels and consonants too, matching the rhythm and all my own, If this pulsation in seven yards long, I want words for it that are seven yards long, Mr, Schulz's words are only two and a half centimetres long,It will serve to show how articulated language comes into being, I let the vowels fool around, I let the vowels quite simply occur, as a cat miaows, Words emerge, shoulders of words, legs, arms, hands of words, Au, oi, uh, One shouldn't let too many words out, A line of poetry is a chance to get rid of all the filth that clings to this accursed language, as if put there by stockbrokers' hands, hands worn smooth by coins, I want the word where it ends and begins, Dada is the heart of words,Each thing has its word, but the word has become a thing by itself, Why shouldn't I find it, Why can't a tree be called Pluplusch, and Pluplubasch when it has been raining, The word, the word, the word outside your domain, your stuffiness, this laughable impotence, your stupendous smugness, outside all the parrotry of your self-evident limitedness, The word, gentlemen, is a public concern of the first importance,The book, a wholly passéist means of preserving and communicating thought, has for a long time been fated to disappear like cathedrals, towers, crenellated walls, museums, and the pacifist ideal, The book, static companion of the sedentary, the nostalgic, the neutralist, cannot entertain or exalt the new Futurist generations intoxicated with revolutionary and bellicose dynamism,The conflagration is steadily enlivening the European sensibility, Our great hygienic war, which should satisfy all our national aspirations, centuples the renewing power of the Italian race, The Futurist cinema, which we are preparing, a joyful deformation of the universe, an alogical, fleeting synthesis of life in the world, will become the best school for boys: a school of joy, of speed, of force, of courage, and heroism, The Futurist cinema will sharpen, develop the sensibility, will quicken the creative imagination, will give the intelligence a prodigious sense of simultaneity and omnipresence, The Futurist cinema will thus cooperate in the general renewal, taking the place of the literary review (always pedantic) and the drama (always predictable), and killing the book (always tedious and oppressive), The necessities of propaganda will force us to publish a book once in a while, But we prefer to express ourselves through the cinema, through great tables of words-in-freedom and mobile illuminated signs,With our manifesto “The Futurist Synthetic Theatre”, with the victorious tours of the theatre companies of Gualtiero Tumiati, Ettore Berti, Annibale Ninchi, Luigi Zoncada, with the two volumes of Futurist Synthetic Theatre containing eighty theatrical syntheses, we have begun the revolution in the Italian prose theatre, An earlier Futurist manifesto had rehabilitated, glorified, and perfected the Variety Theatre, It is logical therefore for us to carry our vivifying energies into a new theatrical zone: the cinema,At first look the cinema, born only a few years ago, may seem to be Futurist already, lacking a past and free from traditions, Actually, by appearing in the guise of theatre without words, it has inherited all the most traditional sweepings of the literary theatre, Consequently, everything we have said and done about the stage applies to the cinema, Our action is legitimate and necessary in so far as the cinema up to now has been and tends to remain profoundly passéist, whereas we see in it the possibility of an eminently Futurist art and the expressive medium most adapted to the complex sensibility of a Futurist artist,Except for interesting films of travel, hunting, wars, and so on, the film-makers have done no more than inflict on us the most backward looking dramas, great and small, The same scenario whose brevity and variety may make it seem advanced is, in most cases, nothing but the most trite and pious analysis, Therefore all the immense artistic possibilities of the cinema still rest entirely in the future, The cinema is an autonomous art, The cinema must therefore never copy the stage, The cinema, being essentially visual, must above all fulfill the evolution of painting, detach itself from reality, from photography, from the graceful and solemn, It must become antigraceful, deforming, impressionistic, synthetic, dynamic, free-wording,One must free the cinema as an expressive medium in order to make it the ideal instrument of a new art, immensely vaster and lighter than all the existing arts, We are convinced that only in this way can one reach that polyexpressiveness towards which all the most modern artistic researches are moving, Today the Futurist cinema creates precisely the polyexpressive symphony that just a year ago we announced in our manifesto “Weights, Measures, and Prices of Artistic Genius”, The most varied elements will enter into the Futurist film as expressive means: from the slice of life to the streak of color, from the conventional line to words-in-freedom, from chromatic and plastic music to the music of objects, In other words it will be painting, architecture, sculpture, words-in-freedom, music of colors, lines, and forms, a jumble of objects and reality thrown together at random, We shall offer new inspirations for the researches of painters, which will tend to break out of the limits of the frame, We shall set in motion the words-in-freedom that smash the boundaries of literature as they march towards painting, music, noise-art, and throw a marvelous bridge between the word and the real object,Our films will be: The mountains, seas, woods, cities, crowds, armies, squadrons, aeroplanes will often be our formidable expressive words: the universe will be our vocabulary, Example: We want to give a sensation of strange cheerfulness: we show a chair cover flying comically around an enormous coat stand until they decide to join, We want to give the sensation of anger: we fracture the angry man into a whirlwind of little yellow balls, We want to give the anguish of a hero who has lost his faith and lapsed into a dead neutral skepticism: we show the hero in the act of making an inspired speech to a great crowd; suddenly we bring on Giovanni Giolitti who treasonably stuffs a thick forkful of macaroni into the hero’s mouth, drowning his winged words in tomato sauce,We shall add color to the dialogue by swiftly, simultaneously showing every image that passes through the actors’ brains, Example: representing a man who will say to his woman: “You’re as lovely as a gazelle,” we shall show the gazelle, Example: if a character says, “I contemplate your fresh and luminous smile as a traveler after a long rough trip contemplates the sea from high on a mountain,” we shall show traveler, sea, mountain,This is how we shall make our characters as understandable as if they talked,Example: “Canto dell’amore” [Song of Love] by Giosuè Carducci:In their German strongholds perched Like falcons meditating the huntWe shall show the strongholds, the falcons in ambush,From the churches that raise long marble arms to heaven, in prayer to God Prom the convents between villages and towns crouching darkly to the sound of bells like cuckoos among far-spaced trees singing boredoms and unexpected joys,We shall show churches that little by little are changed into imploring women, God beaming down from on high, the convents, the cuckoos, and so on,Example: “Sogno d’Estate” [Summer’s Dream] by Giosuè Carducci:Among your ever-sounding strains of battle, Homer, I am conquered by the warm hour: I bow my head in sleep on Scamander’s bank, but my heart flees to the Tyrrhenian Sea,We shall show Carducci wandering amid the tumult of the Achaians, deftly avoiding the galloping horses, paying his respects to Homer, going for a drink with Ajax to the inn, The Red Scamander, and at the third glass of wine his heart, whose palpitations we ought to see, Pops out of his jacket like a huge red balloon and flies over the Gulf Of Rapallo, This is how we make films out of the most secret movements of genius,Thus we shall ridicule the works of the passéist poets, transforming to the great benefit of the public the most nostalgically monotonous weepy poetry into violent, exciting, and highly exhilarating spectacles, Painting + sculpture + plastic dynamism + words-in-freedom + composed noises [intonarumori] + architecture + synthetic theatre = Futurist cinema,This is how we decompose and recompose the universe according to our marvelous whims, to centuple the powers of the Italian creative genius and its absolute preeminence in the world,jolifanto bambla ô falli bambla grossiga m'pfa habla horem égiga goramen higo bloiko russula huju

this manifesto in English DADA ist unsere Intensität: es richted die Bajonette ohne Konsequenz der Sumatrakopf des deutschen Babys; Dada ist das Leben ohne Pantoffeln und Parallelen; das für und gegen die Einheit ist und entschieden gegen die Zukunft; wir wissen aus Weisheit, daß unsere Gehirne bequeme Kopfkissen werden, daß unser Antidogmatismus genauso ausschließend wie der Beamte ist und daß wir nicht frei sind und Freiheit schreien; strenge Notwendigkeit ohne Disziplin und Moral und spucken auf die Menschheit,DADA bleibt im europäischen Rahmen der Schwächen, es ist aber trotzdem Scheiße, um den zoologischen Garten der Kunst mit allen Konsulatsfahnen zu zieren,Wir sind Zirkusdirektoren und pfeifen mitten in den Winden der Jahrmärkte, mitten in den Klöstern, Prostitutionen, Theatern, Realitäten, Gefühlen, Restaurants, ohi, hoho, bang, bang,Wir erklären, daß das Auto ein Gefühl ist, das uns mit den Langsamkeiten seiner Abstraktionen genauso wie die Ozeandampfer, die Geräusche und die Ideen genügend verwöhnt hat, Dennoch veräußerlichen wir die Leichtigkeit, suchen wir nach dem zentralen Wesen und freuen wir uns, wenn wir es verstecken können, Wir wollen nicht die Fenster der wunderbaren Elite aufzählen, denn DADA ist für niemanden vorhanden und wir wollen, daß jeder es versteht, Dort is Dadas Balkon, das versichere ich Ihnen, Von dem man die Militärmärsche hören und herabsteigen kann, indem man die Luft wie ein Seraph durchschneidet, zu einem Bad im Volk, um zu pissen und die Parabel zu verstehen,DADA ist weder Verrücktheit, Weisheit noch Ironie, sieh mich an, netter Bourgeois,Die Kunst war ein Haselnuß-Spiel, die Kinder setzten die Wörter zusammen mit den Klingeln am Ende, dann weinten und schrien sie die Strophe und zogen ihr die Stiefelchen der Puppen an und die Strophe wurde eine Königin, um ein wenig zu sterben und die Strophe wurde ein Wal, die Kinder liefen sich atemlos,Dann kamen die großen Botschafter des Gefühls, die historisch im Chor ausriefen:Psychologie Psychologie hihiWissenschaft Wissenschaft WissenschaftEs lebe FrankreichWir sind nict naivWir folgen aufeinanderWir sind exclusivWir sind nicht einfachund wir können die Intelligenz gut diskutieren,Aber wir, DADA, wir sind nicht ihrer Meinung, denn die Kunst ist nicht ernst, versichere ich Ihnen, und wenn wir das Verbrechen aufzeigen, um gelehrt Ventilator zu sagen, so ist es, um Ihnen etwas zu gefallen, liebe Zuhörer, ich liebe Sie so sehr, versichere ich Ihnen, und ich bete Sie an,klicken Sie hier für dieses Manifest auf Deutsch DADA is our intensity: it erects inconsequential bayonets and the Sumatral head of German babies; Dada is life with neither bedroom slippers nor parallels; it is against and for unity and definitely against the future; we are wise enough to know that our brains are going to become flabby cushions, that our anti dogmatism is as exclusive as a civil servant, and that we cry liberty but are not free; a severe necessity with entire discipline nor morals and that we spit on humanity,DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colours so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates,We are circus ringmasters and we can be found whistling amongst the winds of fairgrounds, in convents, prostitutions, theatres, realities, feelings, restaurants, ohoho, bang bang,We declare that the motor car is a feeling that has cosseted us quite enough in the dilatoriness of its abstractions, as have transatlantic liners, noises and ideas, And while we put on a show of being facile, we are actually searching for the central essence of things, and are pleased if we can hide it; we have no wish to count the windows of the marvellous elite, for DADA doesn't exist for anyone, and we want everyone to understand this, This is Dada's balcony, I assure you, From there you can hear all the military marches, and come down cleaving the air like a seraph landing in a public baths to piss and understand the parable,DADA is neither madness, nor wisdom, nor irony, look at me, dear bourgeois,Art used to be a game of nuts in May, children would go gathering words that had a final ring, then they would exude, shout out the verse, and dress it up in dolls' bootees, and the verse became a queen in order to die a little, and the queen became a sardine, and the children ran hither and you, unseen,Then came the great ambassadors of feeling, who yelled historically in chorus:Psychology Psychology hee heeScience Science ScienceLong live FranceWe are not naiveWe are successiveWe are exclusiveWe are not simpletonsand we are perfectly capable of an intelligent discussion,Be we, DADA, don't agree with them, for art isn't serious, I assure you, and if we reveal the crime so as to show that we are learned denunciators, it's to please you, dear audience, I assure you, and I adore you, Besides,ART does not exist - So it is useless to talk about it - but, people go on being artists - because it's like that and no way else - Well - so what,So we don't like ART and we don't like artists (down with Apollinaire) AND TOGRATH IS RIGHT TO MURDER THE POET, Anyway since we have to disgorge a drop of acid or old lyricism, let's do it quick and fast - for the railway engines run quickly,Modernity therefore constant and killed every night - We ignore Mallarmé, but kindly - but he is dead - But we no longer know Apollinaire, or Cocteau - For - We suspect them of producing art too knowingly, of patching up romanticism with telephone wire and of not knowing the dynamos, THE stars unconnected again, - it's tiresome - and then sometimes don't they talk seriously, A man who believes is peculiar,BUT SINCE SOME ARE BORN HAMS,Well - I can see two ways of letting this go on - Build a personal sensation with a fantastic collision of rare words - not often, though else draw angles, clean squares of feeling - when needed, of course - We shall leave logic Honesty contradictions if necessary - like everyone else,The magic of a word – Dada – which has brought journalists to the gates of a world unforeseen, is of no importance to us,To put out a manifesto you must want: ABC to fulminate against 1, 2, 3 to fly into a rage and sharpen your wings to conquer and disseminate little abcs and big ABCs, to sign, shout, swear, to organize prose into a form of absolute and irrefutable evidence, to prove your non plus ultra and maintain that novelty resembles life just as the latest-appearance of some whore proves the essence of God, His existence was previously proved by the accordion, the landscape, the wheedling word, To impose your ABC is a natural thing - hence deplorable, Everybody does it in the form of crystalbluff-madonna, monetary system, pharmaceutical product, or a bare leg advertising the ardent sterile spring, The love of novelty is the cross of sympathy, demonstrates a naive je m'enfoutisme, it is a transitory, positive sign without a cause, But this need itself is obsolete, In documenting art on the basis of the supreme simplicity: novelty, we are human and true for the sake of amusement, impulsive, vibrant to crucify boredom, At the crossroads of the lights, alert, attentively awaiting the years, in the forest, I write a manifesto and I want nothing, yet I say certain things, and in principle I am against manifestos, as I am also against principles (half-pints to measure the moral value of every phrase too too convenient; approximation was invented by the impressionists), I write this manifesto to show that people can perform contrary actions together while taking one fresh gulp of air; I am against action; for continuous contradiction, for affirmation too, I am neither for nor against and I do not explain because I hate common sense,DADA - this is a word that throws up ideas so that they can be shot down; every bourgeois is a little playwright, who invents different subjects and who, instead of situating suitable characters on the level of his own intelligence, like chrysalises on chairs, tries to find causes or objects (according to whichever psychoanalytic method he practices) to give weight to his plot, a talking and self-defining story,Every spectator is a plotter, if he tries to explain a word (to know,) From his padded refuge of serpentine complications, he allows his instincts to be manipulated, Whence the sorrows of conjugal life,To be plain: The amusement of redbellies in the mills of empty skulls,DADA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHINGIf you find it futile and don't want to waste your time on a word that means nothing , The first thought that comes to these people is bacteriological in character: to find its etymological, or at least its historical or psychological origin, We see by the papers that the Kru Negroes call the tail of a holy cow Dada, The cube and the mother in a certain district of Italy are called: Dada, A hobby horse, a nurse both in Russian and Rumanian: Dada, Some learned journalists regard it as an art for babies, other holy Jesuscallingthelittlechildrenuntohims of our day, as a relapse into a dry and noisy, noisy and monotonous primitivism, Sensibility is not constructed on the basis of a word; all constructions converge on perfection which is boring, the stagnant idea of a gilded swamp, a relative human product, A work of art should not be beauty in itself, for beauty is dead; it should be neither gay nor sad, neither light nor dark to rejoice or torture the individual by serving him the cakes of sacred aureoles or the sweets of a vaulted race through the atmospheres, A work of art is never beautiful by decree, objectively and for all, Hence criticism is useless, it exists only subjectively, for each man separately, without the slightest character of universality, Does anyone think he has found a psychic base common to all mankind, The attempt of Jesus and the Bible covers with their broad benevolent wings: shit, animals, days, How can one expect to put order into the chaos that constitutes that infinite and shapeless variation: man, The principle: "love thy neighbor" is a hypocrisy, "Know thyself" is utopian but more acceptable, for it embraces wickedness, No pity, After the carnage we still retain the hope of a purified mankind, I speak only of myself since I do not wish to convince, I have no right to drag others into my river, I oblige no one to follow me and everybody practices his art in his own way, if be knows the joy that rises like arrows to the astral layers, or that other joy that goes down into the mines of corpse-flowers and fertile spasms, Stalactites: seek them everywhere, in managers magnified by pain, eyes white as the hares of the angels,And so Dada was born* of a need for independence, of a distrust toward unity, Those who are with us preserve their freedom, We recognize no theory, We have enough cubist and futurist academies: laboratories of formal ideas, Is the aim of art to make money and cajole the nice nice bourgeois, Rhymes ring with the assonance of the currencies and the inflexion slips along the line of the belly in profile, All groups of artists have arrived at this trust company utter riding their steeds on various comets, While the door remains open to the possibility of wallowing in cushions and good things to eat,Here we are dropping our anchor in fertile ground,Here we really know what we are talking about, because we have experienced the trembling and the awakening, Drunk with energy, we are revenants thrusting the trident into heedless flesh, We are streams of curses in the tropical abundance of vertiginous vegetation, resin and rain is our sweat, we bleed and burn with thirst, our blood is strength,Cubism was born out of the simple way of looking at an object: Cezanne painted a cup 20 centimetres below his eyes, the cubists look at it from above, others complicate appearance by making a perpendicular section and arranging it conscientiously on the side, (I do not forget the creative artists and the profound laws of matter which they established once and for all,) The futurist sees the same cup in movement, a succession of objects one beside the others and maliciously adds a few force lines, This does not prevent the canvas from being a good or bad painting suitable for the investment of intellectual capital,The new painter creates a world, the elements of which are also its implements, a sober, definite work without argument, The new artist protests: he no longer paints (symbolic and illusionist reproduction) but creates directly in stone, wood, iron, tin, boulders—locomotive organisms capable of being turned in all directions by the limpid wind of momentary sensation, All pictorial or plastic work is useless: let it then be a monstrosity that frightens servile minds, and not sweetening to decorate the refectories of animals in human costume, illustrating the sad fable of mankind,A painting is the art of making two lines, which have been geometrically observed to be parallel, meet on a canvas, before our eyes, in the reality of a world that has been transposed according to new conditions and possibilities, This world is neither specified nor defined in the work, it belongs, in its innumerable variations, to the spectator, For its creator it has neither case nor theory, Order = disorder; ego = non-ego; affirmation - negation: the supreme radiations of an absolute art, Absolute in the purity of its cosmic and regulated chaos, eternal in that globule that is a second which has no duration, no breath, no light and no control, I appreciate an old work for its novelty, It is only contrast that links us to the past, Writers who like to moralise and discuss or ameliorate psychological bases have, apart from a secret wish to win, a ridiculous knowledge of life, which they may have classified, parcelled out, canalised; they are determined to see its categories dance when they beat time, Their readers laugh derisively, but carry on: what's the use,There is one kind of literature which never reaches the voracious masses, The work of creative writers, written out of the author's real necessity, and for his own benefit, The awareness of a supreme egoism, wherein laws become significant, Every page should explode, either because of its profound gravity, or its vortex, vertigo, newness, eternity, or because of its staggering absurdity, the enthusiasm of its principles, or its typography, On the one hand there is a world tottering in its flight, linked to the resounding tinkle of the infernal gamut; on the other hand, there are: the new men, Uncouth, galloping, riding astride on hiccups, And there is a mutilated world and literary medicasters in desperate need of amelioration,I assure you: there is no beginning, and we are not afraid; we aren't sentimental, We are like a raging wind that rips up the clothes of clouds and prayers, we are preparing the great spectacle of disaster, conflagration and decomposition, Preparing to put an end to mourning, and to replace tears by sirens spreading from one continent to another, Clarions of intense joy, bereft of that poisonous sadness, DADA is the mark of abstraction; publicity and business are also poetic elements,I destroy the drawers of the brain, and those of social organisation: to sow demoralisation everywhere, and throw heaven's hand into hell, hell's eyes into heaven, to reinstate the fertile wheel of a universal circus in the Powers of reality, and the fantasy of every individual,Philosophy is the question: from which side shall we look at life, God, the idea or other phenomena, Everything one looks at is false, I do not consider the relative result more important than the choice between cake and cherries after dinner, The system of quickly looking at the other side of a thing in order to impose your opinion indirectly is called dialectics, in other words, haggling over the spirit of fried potatoes while dancing method around it,If I shout:Ideal, Ideal, IdealKnowledge, Knowledge, KnowledgeBoomboom, Boomboom, BoomboomI have given a pretty faithful version of progress, law, morality and all other fine qualities that various highly intelligent men have discussed in so many books, only to conclude that after all everyone dances to his own personal boomboom, and that the writer is entitled to his boomboom: the satisfaction of pathological curiosity a private bell for inexplicable needs; a bath; pecuniary difficulties; a stomach with repercussions in tile; the authority of the mystic wand formulated as the bouquet of a phantom orchestra made up of silent fiddle bows greased with filters made of chicken manure, With the blue eye-glasses of an angel they have excavated the inner life for a dime's worth of unanimous gratitude, If all of them are right and if all pills are Pink Pills, let us try for once not to be right, Some people think they can explain rationally, by thought, what they think, But that is extremely relative, Psychoanalysis is a dangerous disease, it puts to sleep the anti-objective impulses of man and systematizes the bourgeoisie, There is no ultimate Truth, The dialectic is an amusing mechanism which guides us / in a banal kind of way / to the opinions we had in the first place, Does anyone think that, by a minute refinement of logic, he had demonstrated the truth and established the correctness of these opinions, Logic imprisoned by the senses is an organic disease, To this element philosophers always like to add: the power of observation, But actually this magnificent quality of the mind is the proof of its impotence, We observe, we regard from one or more points of view, we choose them among the millions that exist, Experience is also a product of chance and individual faculties, Science disgusts me as soon as it becomes a speculative system, loses its character of utility that is so useless but is at least individual, I detest greasy objectivity, and harmony, the science that finds everything in order, Carry on, my children, humanity, Science says we are the servants of nature: everything is in order, make love and bash your brains in, Carry on, my children, humanity, kind bourgeois and journalist virgins, I am against systems, the most acceptable system is on principle to have none, To complete oneself, to perfect oneself in one's own littleness, to fill the vessel with one's individuality, to have the courage to fight for and against thought, the mystery of bread, the sudden burst of an infernal propeller into economic lilies,DADAIST SPONTANEITYWhat I call the I-don't-give-a-damn attitude of life is when everyone minds his own business, at the same time as he knows how to respect other individualities, and even how to stand up for himself, the two-step becoming a national anthem, a junk shop, the wireless (the wire-less telephone) transmitting Bach fugues, illuminated advertisements for placards for brothels, the organ broadcasting carnations for God, all this at the same time, and in real terms, replacing photography and unilateral catechism,Active simplicity,Inability to distinguish between degrees of clarity: to lick the penumbra and float in the big mouth filled with honey and excrement, Measured by the scale of eternity, all activity is vain - (if we allow thought to engage in an adventure the result of which would be infinitely grotesque and add significantly to our knowledge of human impotence), But supposing life to be a poor farce, without aim or initial parturition, and because we think it our duty to extricate ourselves as fresh and clean as washed chrysanthemums, we have proclaimed as the sole basis for agreement: art, It is not as important as we, mercenaries of the spirit, have been proclaiming for centuries, Art afflicts no one and those who manage to take an interest in it will harvest caresses and a fine opportunity to populate the country with their conversation, Art is a private affair, the artist produces it for himself, an intelligible work is the product of a journalist, and because at this moment it strikes my fancy to combine this monstrosity with oil paints: a paper tube simulating the metal that is automatically pressed and poured hatred cowardice villainy, The artist, the poet rejoice at the venom of the masses condensed into a section chief of this industry, he is happy to be insulted: it is a proof of his immutability, When a writer or artist is praised by the newspapers, it is a proof of the intelligibility of his work: wretched lining of a coat for public use; tatters covering brutality, piss contributing to the warmth of an animal brooding vile instincts, Flabby, insipid flesh reproducing with the help of typographical microbes,We have thrown out the cry-baby in us, Any infiltration of this kind is candied diarrhoea, To encourage this act is to digest it, What we need is works that are strong straight precise and forever beyond understanding, Logic is a complication, Logic is always wrong, It draws the threads of notions, words, in their formal exterior, toward illusory ends and centres, Its chains kill, it is an enormous centipede stifling independence, Married to logic, art would live in incest, swallowing, engulfing its own tail, still part of its own body, fornicating within itself, and passion would become a nightmare tarred with protestantism, a monument, a heap of ponderous grey entrails, But the suppleness, enthusiasm, even the joy of injustice, this little truth which we practice innocently and which makes its beautiful: we are subtle and our fingers are malleable and slippery as the branches of that sinuous, almost liquid plant; it defines our soul, say the cynics, That too is a point of view; but all flowers are not sacred, fortunately, and the divine thing in us is to call to anti-human action, I am speaking of a paper flower for the buttonholes of the gentlemen who frequent the ball of masked life, the kitchen of grace, white cousins lithe or fat, They traffic with whatever we have selected, The contradiction and unity of poles in a single toss can be the truth, If one absolutely insists on uttering this platitude, the appendix of a libidinous, malodorous morality, Morality creates atrophy like every plague produced by intelligence, The control of morality and logic has inflicted us with impassivity in the presence of policemen who are the cause of slavery, putrid rats infecting the bowels of the bourgeoisie which have infected the only luminous clean corridors of glass that remained open to artists,But suppleness, enthusiasm and even the joy of injustice, that little truth that we practise as innocents and that makes us beautiful: we are cunning, and our fingers are malleable and glide like thebranches of that insidious and almost liquid plant; this injustice is the indication of our soul, say the cynics, This is also a point of view; but all flowers aren't saints, luckily, and what is divine in us is the awakening of anti-human action, What we are talking about here is a paper flower for the buttonhole of gentlemen who frequent the ball of masked life, the kitchen of grace, our white, lithe or fleshy girl cousins, They make a profit out of what we have selected, The contradiction and unity of opposing poles at the same time may be true, IF we are absolutely determined to utter this platitude, the appendix of alibidinous, evil-smelling morality, Morals have an atrophying effect, like every other pestilential product of the intelligence, Being governed by morals and logic has made it impossible for us to be anything other than impassive towards policemen - the cause of slavery - putrid rats with whom the bourgeois are fed up to the teeth, and who have infected the only corridors of clear and clean glass that remained open to artists,Let each man proclaim: there is a great negative work of destruction to be accomplished, We must sweep and clean, Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits, who rend one another and destroy the centuries, Without aim or design, without organization: indomitable madness, decomposition, Those who are strong in words or force will survive, for they are quick in defence, the agility of limbs and sentiments flames on their faceted flanks, Morality has determined charity and pity, two balls of fat that have grown like elephants, like planets, and are called good, There is nothing good about them, Goodness is lucid, clear and decided, pitiless toward compromise and politics, Morality is an injection of chocolate into the veins of all men, This task is not ordered by a supernatural force but by the trust of idea brokers and grasping academicians, Sentimentality: at the sight of a group of men quarrelling and bored, they invented the calendar and the medicament wisdom, With a sticking of labels the battle of the philosophers was set off (mercantilism, scales, meticulous and petty measures) and for the second time it was understood that pity is a sentiment like diarrhoea in relation to the disgust that destroys health, a foul attempt by carrion corpses to compromise the sun, I proclaim the opposition of all cosmic faculties to this gonorrhoea of a putrid sun issued from the factories of philosophical thought, I proclaim bitter struggle with all the weapons of –DADAIST DISGUSTEvery product of disgust capable of becoming a negation of the family is Dada; a protest with the fists of its whole being engaged in destructive action: Dada; knowledge of all the means rejected up until now by the shamefaced sex of comfortable compromise and good manners: DADA; abolition of logic, which is the dance of those impotent to create: DADA; of every social hierarchy and equation set up for the sake of values by our valets: DADA: every object, all objects, sentiments, obscurities, apparitions and the precise clash of parallel lines are weapons for the fight: DADA; abolition of memory: Dada; abolition of archaeology: DADA; abolition of prophets: DADA; abolition of the future: DADA; absolute and unquestionable faith in every god that is the immediate product of spontaneity: DADA; elegant and unprejudiced leap from a harmony to the other sphere; trajectory of a word tossed like a screeching phonograph record; to respect all individuals in their folly of the moment: whether it be serious, fearful, timid, ardent, vigorous, determined, enthusiastic; to divest one's church of eve ry useless cumbersome accessory; to spit out disagreeable or amorous ideas like a luminous waterfall, or coddle them—with the extreme satisfaction that it doesn't matter in the least - with the same intensity in the thicket of core's soul pure of insects for blood well-born, and gilded with bodies of archangels, Freedom: DADA DADA DADA, a roaring of tense colors, and interlacing of opposites and of all contradictions, grotesques, inconsistencies:LIFE,* in 1916 at the CABARET VOLTAIRE in ZurichDadaist Manifesto (Berlin)The signatories of this manifesto have, under the battle cryDADA,gathered together to put forward a new art from which they expect the realisation of new ideas, So what is DADAISM, then,The word DADA symbolises the most primitive relationship with the surrounding reality; with Dadaism, a new reality comes into its own,Life is seen in a simultaneous confusion of noises, colours and spiritual rhythms which in Dadaist art are immediately captured by the sensational shouts and fevers of its bold everyday psyche and in all its brutal reality, This is the dividing line between Dadaism and all other artistic trends and especially Futurism which fools have very recently interpreted as a new version of Impressionism,For the first time, Dadaism has refused to take an aesthetic attitude towards life,It tears to pieces all those grand words like ethics, culture, interiorisation which are only covers for weak muscles,THE BRUITIST POEMdescribes a tramcar exactly as it is, the essence of a tramcar with the yawns of Mr Smith and the shriek of brakes,THE SIMULTANEOUS POEMteaches the interrelationship of things, while Mr Smith reads his paper, the Balkan express crosses the Nisch bridge and a pig squeals in the cellar of Mr Bones the butcher,THE STATIC POEMturns words into individuals, The letters of the word "wood" create the forest itself with the leafiness of its trees, the uniforms of the foresters and the wild boar, It could also create the Bellevue Boarding House or Bella Vista, Dadaism leads to fantastic new possibilities in forms of expression in all arts, It made Cubism into a dance on the stage, it spread the Futurist bruitist music all over Europe (for it had no desire to maintain this in its purely Italian context), The word DADA shows the international nature of a movement which is bound by no frontier, religion or profession, Dada is the international expression of our time, the great rebellion of artistic movements, the artistic reflexion of all those many attacks, peace congresses, scuffles in the vegetable markets, social get-togethers, etc,, etc,Dada demands the use ofNEW MATERIALS IN PAINTINGDada is a club which has been founded in Berlin which you can join without any obligations, Here, every man is president and everyone has a vote in artistic matters, Dada is not some pretext to bolster up the pride of a few literary men (as our enemies would have the world believe), Dada is a state of mind which can be revealed in any conversation so that one is forced to say: "This man is a Dadaist, this one isn't," For these reasons, the Dada Club has members all over the world, in Honolulu as well as New Orleans and Meseritz, To be a Dadaist might sometimes mean being a businessman or a politician rather than an artist, being an artist only by accident, To be a Dadaist means being thrown around by events, being against sedimentation; it means sitting for a short instant in an armchair, but it also means putting your life in danger (M, Weng pulled his revolver out of his trouser pocket), A fabric tears under the hand, one says yes to a life that seeks to grow by negation, Say yes, say no; the hurly-burly of existence is a good training ground for the real Dadaist, Here he is lying down, hunting, riding a bicycle, half Pantagruel, half St Francis, laughing and laughing, Down with aesthetic-ethical tendencies, Down with the anaemic abstraction of Expressionism, Down with the literary hollow-heads and their theories for improving the world,Long live Dadaism in word and image, Long live the Dada events of this world, To be against this manifesto is to be a Dadaist,Berlin, April Tristan Tzara, Franz Jung, George Grosz, Marcel Janco, Richard Hülsenbeck, Gerhard Preisz, Raoul HausmannA clear, straightforward gaze must predominate if decisions of great import are to be taken, Spiritually and materially, we demand our right: representatives of an essential part of culture, we, the artists, want to take part in the ideological development of the State; we want to exist in the State and take our full share of responsibilities, We declare that the artistic laws of our time are already formulated in their main outline, The spirit of abstract art represents an enormous extension in man's feeling of freedom, Our faith is fraternal art: art's new mission in society, Art imposes clarity; should serve as a basis for the new man, He should belong to everyone without class distinction, We want to channel the conscious production-strength of each individual into the completion of the communal undertaking, We are fighting lack of system, destroyer of strength, Our highest aspiration is to realise a spiritual basis of understanding for all men, This is our duty, This work ensures the greatest vitality for all people, The initiative for this is ours, We shall direct its course and give expression to its wishes by joining into a harmonious whole its most disparate elements,11 April 1919, Arp, Baumann, Eggeling, Giacometti, Helbig, Henning, Janco, Morach, Richterpreamble = sardanapalus one = suitcase woman = women trousers = water if = moustache 2 = three stick = perhaps after = sightreading irritant = emerald vice = screw october = periscope nerve = or all this drawn together in any old savory, soapy, brusque or definitive order - drawn by lot - is alive, It is thus that over and above the vigilant spirit of the clergyman built at the corner of every road, be it animal, vegetable, imaginable or organic, everything is the same as everything that is not the same, Even if I didn't believe it, it's the truth of the fact that I've put it on paper - because it's a lie that I have FIXED like a butterfly on a hat, Lies circulate - welcome Mister Opportune and Mister Convenient: I arrest them - they're turning into the truth, Thus DADA takes on the job of the two-wheeled cops and of undercover morality, Everyone (at a certain moment) was sound in mind and body, Repeat this 30 times, I consider myself very likeable, II A manifesto is a communication made to the whole world, whose only pretensions is to the discovery of an instant cure for political, astronomical, artistic, parliamentary, agronomical and literary syphilis, It may be pleasant, and good-natured, it's always right, it's strong, vigorous and logical, Apropos of logic, I consider myself very likeable, Pride is the star that yawns and penetrates through the eyes and the mouth, she insists, strikes deep, on her breast is inscribed: you will die, This is her only remedy, Who still believes in doctors, I prefer the poet who is a fart in a steam-engine - he's gentle but he doesn't cry - polite and semi-homosexual, he floats, I don't give a single damn about either one of them, It's by pure (unnecessary) chance that the first should be German and the second Spanish, Far be it from us, in actual fact, the idea of discovering theory of the probability of races and the epistolary perfection of bitterness, III We have always made mistakes, but the greatest mistakes are the poems we have written, Gossip has one single raison d'�tre: the rejuvenation and maintenance of biblical traditions, Gossip is perfecting itself, encouraged by the state-controlled tobacco company, the railways, the hospitals, the undertaking industry and cloth factories, Gossip is encouraged by the culture of the family, Gossip is encouraged by Peter's pence, Every drop of saliva that escapes from a conversation is converted into gold, Since the people have always needed divinities to protect the three essential laws, which are those of God: eating, making love and shitting, since the kinds are on their travels and the laws are too hard, the only thing that counts at the moment is gossip, The form under which it most often appears is DADA, There are some people (journalists, lawyers, amateurs, philosophers) who even think that other forms: business, marriages, visits, wars, various conferences, limited companies, politics, accidents, dance halls, economic crises, fits of hysterics, are variations of dada, Not being an imperialist, I don't share their opinion - I believe, rather, that dada is only a divinity of the second order, which must quite simple by placed beside the other forms of the new mechanism of the religions of the interregnum, Is simplicity simple, or dada, I consider myself rather likeable, IV Is poetry necessary, I know that those who shout loudest against it are actually preparing a comfortable perfection for it; they call it the Future Hygienic, People envisage the (ever-impending) annihilation of art, Here they are looking for a more art-like art, Hygiene becomes mygod mygod purity, Must we no longer believe in words, Since when do they express the contrary of what the organ that utters them things and wants,* Herein lies the great secret: Thought is made in the mouth, I still consider myself very likeable, A great Canadian philosopher said: Thought and the past are also very likeable, V A friend, who is too good a friend of mine not to be very intelligent, said to me the other day:Since diversity is diverting, this game of golf gives the illusion of a "certain" depth, I support all the conventions - to suppress them would be to make new ones, which would complicate our lives in a truly repugnant fashion, We wouldn't know any more what if fashionable: to love the children of the first or second marriage, The "pistil of the pistol" has often landed us in bizarre and restless situations, To disorder meanings - to disorder notions and all the little tropical rains of demoralisation, disorganisation, destruction and billiard-breaks, are actions which are insured against lightning and recognised as being of public utility, There is one known fact: dadaists are only to be found these days in the French Academy, I nevertheless consider myself very likeable, VI It seems that this exists: more logical, very logical, too logical, less logical, not very logical, really logical, fairly logical, Well then, draw the inferences, "I have," Now think of the person you love most, "Have you," Tell me the number and I'll tell you the lottery, VII A priori, in other words with its eyes closed, Dada places before action and above all: Doubt, DADA doubts everything, Dada is an armadillo, Everything is Dada, too, Beware of Dada, Anti-dadaism is a disease: selfkleptomania, man's normal condition, is DADA, But the real dadas are against DADA, The selfkleptomaniac, The person who steals - without thinking of his own interests, or of his will - elements of his individual, is a kleptomaniac, He steals himself, He causes the characters that alienate him from the community to disappear, The bourgeois resemble one another - they're all alike, They used not to be alike, They have been taught to steal - stealing has become a function - the most convenient and least dangerous thing is to steal oneself, They are all very poor, The poor are against DADA, They have a lot to do with their brains, They'll never get to the end of it, They work, The poor are against DADA, He who is against DADA is for me, a famous man said, but then he died, They buried him like a true dadaist, Anno domini Dada, Beware, And remember this example, VIII TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM Take a newspaper, Take some scissors, Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem, Cut out the article, Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag, Shake gently, Next take out each cutting one after the other, Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag, Them poem will resemble you, And there you are - an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd,* * Example: when dogs cross the air in a diamond like ideas and

are some people who explain, because there are others who learn, Abolish hem and all that's left is dada, Dip your pen into a black liquid with manifesto intentions - it's only your autobiography that you're hatching under the belly of the flowering cerebellum, Biography is the paraphernalia of the famous man, Great or strong, And there you are, a simple man like the rest of them, once you've dipped your pen into the ink, full of PRETENSIONS which manifest themselves in forms as diverse as they are unforeseen, which apply to every form of activity and of state of mind and of mimicry: there you are, full of AMBITIONS to keep yourself on the dial of life, in the place where you've only just arrived, to proceed along the illusory and ridiculous upward path towards an apotheosis that only exists in your neurasthenia: there you are, full of PRIDE greater, stronger, more profound than all the others, Dear colleagues: a great man, a little one, a strong, weak, profound, superficial one, that's why you're all going to die, There are some people who have antedated their manifestos to make other people believe that they had the idea of their own greatness a little earlier, My dear colleagues, before after, past future, now yesterday, that's why you're all going to die, There are some people who have said: dada is good because it isn't bad, dada is bad, dada is a religion, dada is a poem, dada is a spirit, dada is sceptical, dada is magic, I know dada, My dear colleagues: good bad, religion poetry, spirit scepticism, definition definition, that's why you're all going to die, and you will die, I promise you, The great mystery is a secret, but it's known to a few people, They will never say what dada is, To amuse you once again I'll tell you something like: dada is the dictatorship of the spirit, or dada is the dictatorship of language, or else dada is the death of the spirit, which will please many of my friends, Friends, X It is certain that since Gambetta, the war, Panama and the Steinheil affair, intelligence is to be found in the street, The intelligent man has become and all-round, normal person, What we lack, what has some interest, what is rare because he has the anomalies of precious being, the freshness and liberty of the great antimen, is THE IDIOT Dada is working with all its might towards the universal installation of the idiot, But consciously, And tends itself to become more and more of one, Dada is terrible: it doesn't feel sorry about the defeats of intelligence, Dada could rather be called cowardly, but cowardly like a mad dog; it recognises neither method nor persuasive excess, The lack of garters which makes it systematically bend down reminds us of the famous lack of system which basically has never existed, The false rumour was started by a laundress at the bottom of her page, the page was taken to the barbaric country where humming-birds act as the sandwich-men of cordial nature, This was told me by a watch-maker who was holding a supple syringe which, in characteristic memory of the hot countries, he called phlegmatic and insinuating, XI Dada is a dog - a compass - the lining of the stomach - neither new nor a nude Japanese girl - a gasometer of jangled feelings - Dada is brutal and doesn't go in for propaganda - Dada is a quantity of life in transparent, effortless and gyratory transformation, XII gentlemen and ladies buy come in and buy and don't read you'll see the fellow who has in his hands the key to niagara the man with a game leg in the game box his hemispheres in a suitcase his nose enclosed in a chinese lantern you'll see you'll see you'll see the belly dance in the massachusetts saloon the fellow who sticks the nail in and the tyre goes down mademoiselle atlantide's silk stockings the trunk that goes 6 times round the world to find the addressee monsieur and his fiancee his brother and his sister-in-law you'll find the carpenter's address the toad-watch the nerve like a paper-knife you'll have the address of the minor pin for the feminine sex and that of the fellow who supplies the obscene photos to the kind of greece as well as the address of l'action francaise, XIII DADA is a virgin microbe DADA is against the high cost of living DADA limited company for the exploitation of ideas DADA has 391 different attitudes and colours according to the sex of the president It changes - affirms - says the opposite at the same time - no importance - shouts - goes fishing, Dada is the chameleon of rapid and self-interested change, Dada is against the future, Dada is dead, Dada is absurd, Long live Dada, Dada is not a literary school, howl XIV To "prettify" life in the lorgnette - a blanket of caresses - a panoply with butterflies - that's the life of life's chambermaids, To sleep on a razor and on fleas in rut - to travel in a barometer - to piss like a cartridge - to make faux pas, be idiotic, take showers of holy minutes - be beaten, always be the last one - shout out the opposite of what the other fellow says - be the editorial office and the bathroom of God who every day takes a bath in us in company with the cesspool clearer - that's the life of dadaists, To be intelligent - respect everyone - die on the field of honour - subscribe to the Loan - vote for So-and-So - respect for nature and painting - to barrack at dada manifestations - that's the life of men, XV DADA is not a doctrine to be put into practice: Dada - is for lying: a successful business, Dada gets into debt and doesn't live on its well-filled wallet, The good Lord created a universal language, that's why people don't take him seriously, A language is a utopia, God can allow himself not to be successful: so can Dada, That's why the critics say: Dada goes in for luxuries, or Dada is in rut, God goes in for luxuries, or God is in rut, Who's right: God, Dada or the critic, "You're deviating," a charming reader tells me, - No no, not at all, I simply wanted to reach the conclusion: Subscribe to Dada, the only loan that doesn't pay, XVI howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl

you, but it is so, they want to empty the snow out of their pipe on to Dada, Are you sure, Perfectly, the facts speak for themselves from great grotesque mouths, They think that Dada wants to stop them in their hateful trade: selling pictures at a high price, Art is dearer than sausages, dearer than women, dearer than anything, Art is as easy to see as God (see Saint-Sulpice), Art is a pharmaceutical product for idiots, Tables turn, thanks to the spirits; pictures and other works of art are like strong- box-tables, the spirit is within them and gets more and more inspired as the prices rise in the salerooms, Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, dear friends, Dealers do not like painting, they know about the hidden spirit, Buy reproductions of signed pictures, Don't be snobbish; having the same picture as your neighbour doesn't make you any less intelligent, No more fly-specks on the walls, There will be some, all the same, but not quite so many, Dada will certainly get more and more hated, for its wire-cutters allow it to cut processions singing "Come Darling", what a sacrilege, Cubism represents total famine in ideas, They cubed primitive paintings, cubed Negro sculptures, cubed violins, cubed guitars, cubed picture magazines, cubed shit and girls' profiles and now they want to cube money, Dada, on the other hand, wants nothing, absolutely nothing, and what it does is to make the public say "We understand nothing, nothing, nothing", "The Dadaists are nothing, nothing, nothing and they will surely succeed in nothing, nothing, nothing," 391, No, 12, Paris, March 1920 Francis Picabia who knows nothing, nothing, nothing,I sleep very late, I commit suicide at 65%, My life is very cheap, it's only 30% of life for me, My life has 30% of life, It lacks arms, strings and a few buttons, 5% is devoted to a state of semi-lucid stupor accompanied by anaemic crackling, This 5% is called DADA, So life is cheap, Death is a bit more expensive, But life is charming and death is equally charming, A few days ago I was at a meeting of imbeciles, There were a lot of people there, Everyone was charming, Tristan Tzara, a small, absurd and insignificant individual was giving a lecture on the art of becoming charming, He was charming, at that, Everyone is charming, And witty, It's delightful, isn't it, Everyone is delightful, at that, 9 degrees below zero, It's charming, isn't it, No, it isn't charming, God isn't up to it, He isn't even in the directory, But even so he's charming, Ambassadors, poets, counts, princes, musicians, journalists, actors, writers, diplomats, directors, dressmakers, socialists, princesses and baronesses are charming, You're all of you charming, very subtle, witty and delightful, Tristan Tzara says to you: he's quite willing to do something else, but he prefers to remain an idiot, a practical joker and a hoaxer, Be sincere for a moment: what I've just said to you - is it charming or idiotic, There are some people (journalists, lawyers, amateurs, philosophers) who even think that business, marriages, visits, wars, various conferences, limited companies, politics, accidents, dance halls, economic crises, fits of hysterics, are variations of dada, Not being an imperialist, I don't share their opinion, I believe rather, that dada is only a divinity of the second order, which must quite simply be placed beside the other forms of the new mechanism of the religions of the interregnum, Is simplicity simple, or dada, I consider myself rather likeable, See also 01001 con1001101001der my10011elf r0000110100her l01001ke00001ble by Tristan Tzara and Samantha du Raeno, 2007You are all indicted, stand up, It is impossible to talk to you unless you are standing up, Stand up as you would for the Marseillaise or God Save the King, Stand up, as if the Flag were before you, Or as if you were in the presence of Dada, which signifies Life, and which accuses you of loving everything out of snobbery if only it is expensive enough, One dies a hero's death or an idiot's death - which comes to the same thing, The only word that has more than a day-to-day value is the word Death, You love death - the death of others, Kill them, Let them die, Only money does not die; it only goes away for a little while, That is God, That is someone to respect: someone you can take seriously, Money is the prie-Dieu of entire families, Money for ever, Long live money, The man who has money is a man of honour, Honour can be bought and sold like the arse, The arse, the arse, represents life like potato-chips, and all you who are serious-minded will smell worse than cow's shit, Dada alone does not smell: it is nothing, nothing, nothing, It is like your hopes: nothing like your paradise: nothing like your idols: nothing like your heroes: nothing like your artists: nothing like your religions: nothing, Hiss, shout, kick my teeth in, so what, I shall still tell you that you are half-wits, In three months my friends and I will be selling you our pictures for a few francs,TO THE PUBLIC Before going down among you to pull out your decaying teeth, your running ears, your tounges full of sores,your too fatted liver, your ignoble spleen and your diabetic kidneys,mathematical and poetic metaphysical pepper and cucumbers,you with passion,without the pursuit of I worship you which is a French boxer maritime values as irregular as the depression of Dada in the blood of a bicephalous animal I glide between death and the vague phosphates that scratch slightly at the common brain of dadaist poets luckily because gold mine tariffs and the high cost of living made me Decide to abandon D's it isn't true that sham dadas have Deprived me of them because here's enough to bewail the nothing that is called nothing and I've cleared illnesses at the customs I the carapace and umbrella of the brain from noon till two o'clock two hour's subscription superstitious releasing the mechanism of the spermatozoon ballet that you'll find being dress-rehearsed in all the hearts of suspect individuals I'll eat your fingers a bit I'm renewing your subscription to the celluloid love that creaks like metal gates and you are idiots I shall come back once in the guise of your renascent urine as the obstetric wind of joie de vivre and I'm going to establish a boarding school for poets' supporters and I've come again to start again and you're all idiots and the selfkleptomaniac's key only works with crepuscular oil on every knot of every machine there's the nose of a new-born baby and we're all idiots and very suspect of a new form of intelligence and a new logic after our own manner which isn't at all Dada and you're letting yourselves be led astray by Aaism and you're all idiots poultices of the surgical spirit of purified sleep of bandages and of virgin idiotsLong live the undertakers of the combine,Every act is a revolver shot - both the insignificant gesture and the decisive moment are attacks (I open the fan of knock-outs for the distillation of the air that separates us) - and with the words put down on paper I enter, solemnly, into myself, In the scalp of notions I implant my 60 fingers and brutally shake the curtains, the teeth, the bolts of their joints, I shut, I open, I spit, Careful, The moment has come when I should tell you I've been lying, If there is a system in the lack of system - that of my proportions - I never apply it, In other words, I lie, I lie when I apply it, I lie when I don't apply it, I lie when I write that I lie because I do not lie - because I have lived the mirror of my father - chosen from the profits of baccarat - from town to town - for myself has never been myself - for the saxophone wears like a rose the assassination of the visceral car-driver - he's made of sexual copper and leaves of racecourses, Thus drummed the maize, the alarm and pellagra where the matches grow,Extermination, Yes, naturally, But doesn't exist, Myself: mixture kitchen theatre, Long live the stretcher-bearers of the convocations of ecstasies, Lying is ecstasy - which lasts longer than a second - there is nothing that lasts longer, Idiots brood over the century - they start all over again several centuries later - idiots remain within the circle for ten years - idiots hover over the dial of a year - Myself (an idiot) I stay there for five minutes, The claim of the blood to distribute in my body and my event the accidental colour of the first woman I touched with my eyes in these tentacular times, The bitterest banditry is to finish one's thought-out phrase, The banditry of the gramophone, the little anti-human mirage that I like in myself - because I believe it to be ridiculous and dishonest, But the bankers of language will always get their little percentage on the discussion, The presence of (at least) one boxer is indispensible for a match - affiliated members of a gang of dadaist assassins have signed a self-protection contract for operations of this sort, Their number is extremely limited - the presence of (at least) one singer for a duet, or (at least) one signatory for a receipt, of (at least) one eye for sight, being absolutely indispensible,Put the photographic plate of the face in the acid bath,The shocks that have sensitized it will become visible and will surprise you,Punch yourself in the face and drop dead,The Electric-Vibrating-Luminous Theatre will express what the new form of art proposes to do, This theatre will translate and simplify previous concepts of art, In this theatre, the message will be understood and perceived by everyone, The artist will convey its message through light, aesthetics, and vibrations, The stage is dark and the backdrop contains groups of electric lamps varying in color and tone, The theatre is completely electric conveying its message in shapes of light and color,Brief, elementary hints and a small practical example of Electric-Vibrating-Luminous Theatre will serve to give to youth a concept of what the new form of art wishes to be and what it proposes to do,It does not wish to throw away completely the other innovating schools, but it searches only to translate and simplify, in coloured and luminous vibrations, concepts of art that have already been treated by other techniques (theatre-music-painting-poetry-etc,),Not all men, in fact, have their own sensitivity equitably distributed in the five senses, so that they indifferently perceive a work of art that the artist created according to his own ability, For example, since not all men completely perceive a dramatic-auditory action with characters on stage, the Electric-Vibrating-Luminous Theatre translates the same dramatic conception, with its equivalent emotional power, in such a way that the deaf can also perceive the different cerebral vibrations that gave rise to the dramatic concept,However, one must deduce from this that the Electric-Vibrating-Luminous Theatre is only the primary formula of a work of art, the synthetic-symptomatic and aesthetic exposition of a pure work, free from frivolous technical means of expression,But, since there is no art if there is no creation, and the Electric-Vibrating-Luminous Theatre wishes to be art it later will be able to attain a superior state of technical proficiency, to create dramas, musical symphonies, symbolic dances, etc,, for this new form of ultradynamic art, This new art form, if well felt by the artist, will offer him a new way to express his own sensibility and his own thoughts, by means of luminous, aesthetic, and clear vibrations,The stage looks like an enormous dark chamber of a camera, that is to say, a floor, backdrop, ceiling, and lateral faces of black planes (of board or velvet) hermetically welded together,The backcloth, which constitutes the scenery and which we shall call "sensitive darkness," is formed from myriads of electric lamps of every colour and tonality, The studied distribution of colours and the studied distribution of electrical currents comprise the subject and treatment of the work, Behind the backcloth an electrical cylinder switch works, which, acting like a phonograph cylinder, lights up now one, now another, zone of the sensitive darkness,It is well to bear in mind that the Electric Theatre, being eminently dynamic and based on colour and movement, does not allow its luminous vibrations to be geometric expressions like triangles, squares, trapezoids, etc,, etc, Instead, they are light-points, nebulas, straight segments, curves, parabolas, hyperbolas, helicoids, ellipses, ellipsoids, spirals, circles, concentrics, eccentrics, ovals, etc,To summarise with a brief example, we condense the third act of The Life of Man by Leonid Andreyev, To be precise, the "ball",First Scene, A red curtain rises, The sensitive darkness is covered by a nebula of points of every colour, paired two by two, which turn with a rotating and revolving motion, They criss-cross one another,Tonality: Reds, greens, yellows, dark blues, etc, etc,, with a cold tonality predominant,At Left: Almost lost in the sensitive darkness "He" stands immobile, represented by a row of yellowish lights in the form of an S, in the middle of which a tuft of "bluish-red" trembles,At Right: In a corner at the back "three boring and monotonous musicians" are expressed by three verticals of a very gloomy violet in three different sizes, as in Indian file, The three verticals light up and darken rhythmically and gradually, controlled by the electrical current, For the entire duration of the act they continue their vibro-luminous sound at the same tempo,The ball lights up, It is formed by swift spirals of every colour that turn in all directions, Several lights move automatically between the dancing couples, They form small nebulas of blue and red lights that quickly break up in all directions,Coloured merrymaking, Now and then, the sensitive darkness freezes the multicoloured expressions for several seconds and only the three musicians operate dimly,At other times a determined image curves quickly and deliberately toward the right for a moment before returning to the ball,Second Scene, The sensitive darkness finishes with the coloured expression, From the right a deep orange splash expands and distends itself until it totally covers the surface of the sensitive darkness, Then a second of darkness, Then again two luminous beams of light come from the right, Golden lights stop at the head of Man and Woman, Behind is a retinue of Friends and Enemies,The Friends are expressed by a tonality of red and dark-blue lights that move rhythmically and straight ahead, The Enemies are expressed by a yellow and green tonality and proceed to cast off small arcs of circles in a zigzag manner,On each side of the two beams the dancers, with uniform and equal movement, separate and come together, expressing solemn curtsies, Whisper of lights, Comments of colour, The three musicians play just as in the first scene,Third Scene, The two luminous processions collect on the left at the back and come down bowing, The dancers move and slowly seek each other, grouping themselves by colour and by tone, Nebulas of reds, yellows, greens, purples, violets, browns, whites, etc, etc, Then, in small dancing groups they disappear to the right, Only a very yellowish yellow (other than He and the musicians) remains on the sensitive darkness, It makes a turn on the floor, pirouettes, and then disappears to the right,Last Scene, Darkness, except that the left is occupied by He, who is immobile, and the right corner is occupied by the three musicians, who are still playing, Slowly the three musicians creep to the middle of the sensitive darkness, They meet in the centre and enlarge proportionately until the tallest occupies the entire height of the backcloth, Thus they continue to play, greatly slackening the tempo,He rapidly crosses the stage and stands immobile on the left, His bluish-red tuft in the centre diminishes to three-fourths its original height and pauses, flickering,Have a good look at me, I'm an idiot, I'm a practical joker, I'm a hoaxer, Have a good look at me, I'm ugly, my face has no expression, I'm small, I'm like the rest of you,1 But ask yourselves, before you look at me, whether the iris by which you dispatch arrows of liquid sentiments isn't in fact fly-shit, if you belly's eyes are not sections of tumours who looks will at one moment emerge from some part of your body in the form of a blennorrhagic discharge, You see with your navels - why do you hid from your navels the ridiculous spectacle we offer them, And lower down, women's genitals, love, pure love, naturally - rare steaks and oil painting, Everybody who looks and who understands can easily be classified somewhere between poetry and love, between steak and painting, They'll be digested, they'll be digested, I was recently accused of the theft of some furs, Probably because people thought I should still be classified as a poet, One of those poets who satisfy their legitimate need of cold onania in hot furs, H a H u, I know other, equally platonic, pleasures, Ring up your family on the telephone and piss down the hole designed for musical, gastronomic and sacred nonsense,DADA suggests 2 solutions:NO MORE LOOKS, NO MORE WORDS,2Stop looking, Stop talking,For I, chameleon alteration infiltration with convenient attitudes - multicoloured opinions for every occasion size and price - I do the opposite of what I recommend to other people,3I've forgotten something:where , why , how , in other words: the ventilator of cold examples will serve the fragile snake of the procession and I have never had the pleasure of seeing you, my dear, the ear will take itself out of the envelope rigid like all marine equipment and the products of Aa & Co's firm, chewing-gum for example and dogs have blue eyes, I drink chamomile tea, they drink the wind, DADA introduces new points of view, people site down now at the corners of tables, in attitudes which lean a bit to the left and to the right, that's why I've quarrelled with Dada, insist everywhere on the suppression of the Ds, eat Aa, brush yourself with Aa toothpaste, buy your clothes at Aa's, Aa is a handkerchief and genitals blowing their noses rapid collapse - made of rubber - noiseless, needs neither manifestos nor address books, it gives a 25% discount buy your clothes at Aa's he has blue eyes,1 I wanted to give myself a bit of publicity, 2 No more manifestos, 3 Sometimes,I hereby declare that on February 8th, 1916, Tristan Tzara discovered the word DADA, I was present with my twelve children when Tzara pronounced for the first time this word which has aroused in us such legitimate enthusiasm, This took place at the Café Terrasse in Zurich, and I wore a brioche in my left nostril, I am convinced that this word has no importance and that only imbeciles and Spanish professors can be interested in dates, What interests us is the Dada spirit and we were all Dada before the existence of Dada, The first Holy Virgins I painted date from 1886, when I was a few months old and amused myself by pissing graphic impressions, The morality of idiots and their belief in geniuses makes me shit,For the last two months I have been living in the Place Blanche, It is a very mild winter and women make short and delightful appearances at the tables in front of the café where we sit with our drug alcohol, The nights exist only in the hyperborean lands of legend, I can't remember ever having lived anywhere else; those who say they know me must be mistaken, Though now they say they thought that I was dead, You are right to call me to order, After all, who's speaking, André Breton, a man of rather small courage, who has up to now been more or less satisfied with one act of derision and that probably because one day he just felt permanently unable to do whathe wanted, And it's true that I have a feeling of having done badly for myself on many occasions; it's true that I find I am less than a monk, less than an adventurer, But I still have a feeling that I shall find myself again and that in these early days of 1922 in the midst of gay and lovely Montmartre I am thinking what I can do with my life, These days, we think of everything in terms of its opposite and of the union of both into one single category, this itself reconcilable with the first term and so on until the mind reaches the absolute idea, the reconciliation of all oppositions and the unity of all categories, If Dada had been this, then it would not have been so bad, even though I would still prefer the busy life of the first little tart I see to the sleep of Hegel on his laurels, Dada is far from such considerations, The proof of this lies in the fact that today, when it takes great delight in being taken for a vicious circle: "Some day or other, we shall know that before Dada, after Dada, without Dada, towards Dada, in spite of Dada, against Dada, it is always Dada", without noticing that it deprives itself thereby of all virtue and meaningfulness, it is astonished to find that its only supporters are poor fools who live in a world of the past, waxing warm and fierce at the memory of misdeeds long ago, The danger moved elsewhere a long time ago, And what does it matter if M, Tzara has to share his glory with Marinetti and Baju, They say I change friends the way some people change their boots, But I can't go on wearing the same pair for ever and when they don't fit me any more, I give them to my servants, I like and admire Francis Picabia and it would not upset me in the least if some of his comments about me were repeated, They have done all they could to mislead him about the way I feel, seeing clearly that if we were to understand each other, it would compromise the established position of those already settled in, Dadaism, like so many other things, has for some people been just a way of settling in, One thing I did not say earlier was that there can be no absolute idea, We have been subjected to a sort of mental mimicry which has stopped us going deeply into anything and has made us look with hostility at anything we held dear, To give one's life for an idea, Dada or the one I am evolving right now, would only cause great intellectual poverty, Ideas are neither good nor bad, they just are: and they can still rouse passion of one kind or another in my mind, You will forgive me if I maintain that, unlike ivy, I die if I cling on hard to something, Would you like me to worry in case these words seem to attack that cult of friendship which, according to M, Binet-Valmer, is at the basis of the cult of patriotism, I can only assure you that I don't give a damn about it and repeat: Drop everything, Drop Dada, Drop your wife, your mistress, Drop your hopes and fears, Sow your children in the corner of a wood, Drop the substance for the shadow, Drop your easy life and preparation for a comfortable future, Get out and go, from Littérature (new series) No, 2, 1 April 1922One must become acquainted with everybody except oneself; one must not know which sex one belongs to; I do not care whether I am male or female, I do not admire men more than I do women, Having no virtue, I am assured of not suffering from them, Many people seek the road which can lead them to their ideal: I have no ideal; the person who parades his ideal is only an arriviste, Undoubtedly, I am also an arriviste, but my lack of scruples is an invention for myself, a subjectivity, Objectively it would consist of awarding myself the légion d'honneur, of wishing to become a minister or of plotting to get into the Institute, Well, for me, all that is shit, What I like is to invent, to imagine, to make myself a new man every moment, then forget him, forget everything, We should be equipped with a special eraser, gradually effacing our works and the memory of them, Our brain should be nothing back a blackboard, or white, or better, a mirror in which we would see ourselves for a moment, only to turn our back on it two minutes later, My ambition is to be a man sterile for others; the man who set himself up as a school disgusts me, he gives his gonorrhea to artists for nothing and sells it as clearly as possible to amateurs, Actually, writers, painters, and other idiots have passed on the word to fight against the 'monsters', monsters who, naturally, do not exist, who are pure inventions, of man, Artists are afraid; they whisper in each other's ears about a boogey man which might well prevent them from playing their dirty little tricks, No age, I believe, has been more imbecilic than ours, These gentlemen would have us believe that nothing is happening anymore; the train reversing its engines, it seems, is very pretty to look at, cows are no longer enough, The travelers to this backward Decanville are named: Matisse, Morandi, Braque, Picasso, Léger, de Segonzac, etc,, etc, , What is funniest of all is that they accept, as stationmaster, Louis Vauxcelles, whose great black napkin contains only a foetus, Since the war, a ponderous and half-witted sentiment of morality rules the entire world, The moralists never discern the moral facts of appearances, the Church for them is a morality like the morality of drinking water, or of not daring to wash one's ass in front of a parrot, All that is arbitrary; people with morals are badly informed, and those who are informed know that the others will not inform themselves, There is no such thing as a moral problem; morality like modesty is one of the greatest stupidities, The asshole of morality should take the form of a chamber-pot, that's all the objectivity I ask of it, This contagious disease called morality has succeeded in contaminating all of the so-called artistic milieux; writers and painters become serious people, and soon we shall have a minister of painting and literature; I don't doubt that there will be still more frightful assininities, The poets no longer know what to say, so some are becoming Catholics, others believers; these men manufacture their little scribblings as Félix Potin does his cold chicken preserves; people say that Dada is the end of romanticism, that I am a clown, and they cry long live classicism which will save the pure souls and their ambitions, the simple souls so dear to those afflicted by dreams of grandeur, However, I do not abandon the hope that nothing is finished yet, I am here, and so are several friends who have a love of life, a life we do not know and which interests us for that very reason, originally published in Littérature, new series no, 8, Paris, January 1923 as 'Francis Merci,'[391,org note: this manifesto is included in our archive of dada manifestos because of the relevance to the 2005 klitink manifesto] So strong is the belief in life, in what is most fragile in life - real life, I mean - that in the end this belief is lost, Man, that inveterate dreamer, daily more discontent with his destiny, has trouble assessing the objects he has been led to use, objects that his nonchalance has brought his way, or that he has earned through his own efforts, almost always through his own efforts, for he has agreed to work, at least he has not refused to try his luck (or what he calls his luck,), At this point he feels extremely modest: he knows what women he has had, what silly affairs he has been involved in; he is unimpressed by his wealth or his poverty, in this respect he is still a newborn babe and, as for the approval of his conscience, I confess that he does very nicely without it, If he still retains a certain lucidity, all he can do is turn back toward his childhood which, however his guides and mentors may have botched it, still strikes him as somehow charming, There, the absence of any known restrictions allows him the perspective of several lives lived at once; this illusion becomes firmly rooted within him; now he is only interested in the fleeting, the extreme facility of everything, Children set off each day without a worry in the world, Everything is near at hand, the worst material conditions are fine, The woods are white or black, one will never sleep, But it is true that we would not dare venture so far, it is not merely a question of distance, Threat is piled upon threat, one yields, abandons a portion of the terrain to be conquered, This imagination which knows no bounds is henceforth allowed to be exercised only in strict accordance with the laws of an arbitrary utility; it is incapable of assuming this inferior role for very long and, in the vicinity of the twentieth year, generally prefers to abandon man to his lusterless fate, Though he may later try to pull himself together on occasion, having felt that he is losing by slow degrees all reason for living, incapable as he has become of being able to rise to some exceptional situation such as love, he will hardly succeed, This is because he henceforth belongs body and soul to an imperative practical necessity which demands his constant attention, None of his gestures will be expansive, none of his ideas generous or far-reaching, In his mind's eye, events real or imagined will be seen only as they relate to a welter of similar events, events in which he has not participated, abortive events, What am I saying: he will judge them in relationship to one of these events whose consequences are more reassuring than the others, On no account will he view them as his salvation, Beloved imagination, what I most like in you is your unsparing quality, There remains madness, "the madness that one locks up," as it has aptly been described, That madness or another, We all know, in fact, that the insane owe their incarceration to a tiny number of legally reprehensible acts and that, were it not for these acts their freedom (or what we see as their freedom) would not be threatened, I am willing to admit that they are, to some degree, victims of their imagination, in that it induces them not to pay attention to certain rules - outside of which the species feels threatened - which we are all supposed to know and respect, But their profound indifference to the way in which we judge them, and even to the various punishments meted out to them, allows us to suppose that they derive a great deal of comfort and consolation from their imagination, that they enjoy their madness sufficiently to endure the thought that its validity does not extend beyond themselves, And, indeed, hallucinations, illusions, etc,, are not a source of trifling pleasure, The best controlled sensuality partakes of it, and I know that there are many evenings when I would gladly that pretty hand which, during the last pages of Taine's L'Intelligence, indulges in some curious misdeeds, I could spend my whole life prying loose the secrets of the insane, These people are honest to a fault, and their naiveté has no peer but my own, Christopher Columbus should have set out to discover America with a boatload of madmen, And note how this madness has taken shape, and endured, It is not the fear of madness which will oblige us to leave the flag of imagination furled,The case against the realistic attitude demands to be examined, following the case against the materialistic attitude, The latter, more poetic in fact than the former, admittedly implies on the part of man a kind of monstrous pride which, admittedly, is monstrous, but not a new and more complete decay, It should above all be viewed as a welcome reaction against certain ridiculous tendencies of spiritualism, Finally, it is not incompatible with a certain nobility of thought,By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement, I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit, It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays, It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life, The activity of the best minds feels the effects of it; the law of the lowest common denominator finally prevails upon them as it does upon the others, An amusing result of this state of affairs, in literature for example, is the generous supply of novels, Each person adds his personal little "observation" to the whole, As a cleansing antidote to all this, M, Paul Valéry recently suggested that an anthology be compiled in which the largest possible number of opening passages from novels be offered; the resulting insanity, he predicted, would be a source of considerable edification, The most famous authors would be included, Such a though reflects great credit on Paul Valéry who, some time ago, speaking of novels, assured me that, so far as he was concerned, he would continue to refrain from writing: "The Marquise went out at five," But has he kept his word,If the purely informative style, of which the sentence just quoted is a prime example, is virtually the rule rather than the exception in the novel form, it is because, in all fairness, the author's ambition is severely circumscribed, The circumstantial, needlessly specific nature of each of their notations leads me to believe that they are perpetrating a joke at my expense, I am spared not even one of the character's slightest vacillations: will he be fairhaired, what will his name be, will we first meet him during the summer, So many questions resolved once and for all, as chance directs; the only discretionary power left me is to close the book, which I am careful to do somewhere in the vicinity of the first page, And the descriptions, There is nothing to which their vacuity can be compared; they are nothing but so many superimposed images taken from some stock catalogue, which the author utilizes more and more whenever he chooses; he seizes the opportunity to slip me his postcards, he tries to make me agree with him about the clichés:The small room into which the young man was shown was covered with yellow wallpaper: there were geraniums in the windows, which were covered with muslin curtains; the setting sun cast a harsh light over the entire setting, There was nothing special about the room, The furniture, of yellow wood, was all very old, A sofa with a tall back turned down, an oval table opposite the sofa, a dressing table and a mirror set against the pierglass, some chairs along the walls, two or three etchings of no value portraying some German girls with birds in their hands - such were the furnishings, (Dostoevski, Crime and Punishment) I am in no mood to admit that the mind is interested in occupying itself with such matters, even fleetingly, It may be argued that this school-boy description has its place, and that at this juncture of the book the author has his reasons for burdening me, Nevertheless he is wasting his time, for I refuse to go into his room, Others' laziness or fatigue does not interest me, I have too unstable a notion of the continuity of life to equate or compare my moments of depression or weakness with my best moments, When one ceases to feel, I am of the opinion one should keep quiet, And I would like it understood that I am not accusing or condemning lack of originality as such, I am only saying that I do not take particular note of the empty moments of my life, that it may be unworthy for any man to crystallize those which seem to him to be so, I shall, with your permission, ignore the description of that room, and many more like it,Not so fast, there; I'm getting into the area of psychology, a subject about which I shall be careful not to joke,The author attacks a character and, this being settled upon, parades his hero to and fro across the world, No matter what happens, this hero, whose actions and reactions are admirably predictable, is compelled not to thwart or upset -- even though he looks as though he is -- the calculations of which he is the object, The currents of life can appear to lift him up, roll him over, cast him down, he will still belong to this readymade human type, A simple game of chess which doesn't interest me in the least -- man, whoever he may be, being for me a mediocre opponent, What I cannot bear are those wretched discussions relative to such and such a move, since winning or losing is not in question, And if the game is not worth the candle, if objective reason does a frightful job -- as indeed it does -- of serving him who calls upon it, is it not fitting and proper to avoid all contact with these categories, "Diversity is so vast that every different tone of voice, every step, cough, every wipe of the nose, every sneeze,"* (Pascal,) If in a cluster of grapes there are no two alike, why do you want me to describe this grape by the other, by all the others, why do you want me to make a palatable grape, Our brains are dulled by the incurable mania of wanting to make the unknown known, classifiable, The desire for analysis wins out over the sentiments,** (Barrès, Proust,) The result is statements of undue length whose persuasive power is attributable solely to their strangeness and which impress the reader only by the abstract quality of their vocabulary, which moreover is ill-defined, If the general ideas that philosophy has thus far come up with as topics of discussion revealed by their very nature their definitive incursion into a broader or more general area, I would be the first to greet the news with joy, But up till now it has been nothing but idle repartee; the flashes of wit and other niceties vie in concealing from us the true thought in search of itself, instead of concentrating on obtaining successes, It seems to me that every act is its own justification, at least for the person who has been capable of committing it, that it is endowed with a radiant power which the slightest gloss is certain to diminish, Because of this gloss, it even in a sense ceases to happen, It gains nothing to be thus distinguished, Stendhal's heroes are subject to the comments and appraisals -- appraisals which are more or less successful -- made by that author, which add not one whit to their glory, Where we really find them again is at the point at which Stendahl has lost them, We are still living under the reign of logic: this, of course, is what I have been driving at, But in this day and age logical methods are applicable only to solving problems of secondary interest, The absolute rationalism that is still in vogue allows us to consider only facts relating directly to our experience, Logical ends, on the contrary, escape us, It is pointless to add that experience itself has found itself increasingly circumscribed, It paces back and forth in a cage from which it is more and more difficult to make it emerge, It too leans for support on what is most immediately expedient, and it is protected by the sentinels of common sense, Under the pretense of civilization and progress, we have managed to banish from the mind everything that may rightly or wrongly be termed superstition, or fancy; forbidden is any kind of search for truth which is not in conformance with accepted practices, It was, apparently, by pure chance that a part of our mental world which we pretended not to be concerned with any longer -- and, in my opinion by far the most important part -- has been brought back to light, For this we must give thanks to the discoveries of Sigmund Freud, On the basis of these discoveries a current of opinion is finally forming by means of which the human explorer will be able to carry his investigation much further, authorized as he will henceforth be not to confine himself solely to the most summary realities, The imagination is perhaps on the point of reasserting itself, of reclaiming its rights, If the depths of our mind contain within it strange forces capable of augmenting those on the surface, or of waging a victorious battle against them, there is every reason to seize them -- first to seize them, then, if need be, to submit them to the control of our reason, The analysts themselves have everything to gain by it, But it is worth noting that no means has been designated a priori for carrying out this undertaking, that until further notice it can be construed to be the province of poets as well as scholars, and that its success is not dependent upon the more or less capricious paths that will be followed, Freud very rightly brought his critical faculties to bear upon the dream, It is, in fact, inadmissible that this considerable portion of psychic activity (since, at least from man's birth until his death, thought offers no solution of continuity, the sum of the moments of the dream, from the point of view of time, and taking into consideration only the time of pure dreaming, that is the dreams of sleep, is not inferior to the sum of the moments of reality, or, to be more precisely limiting, the moments of waking) has still today been so grossly neglected, I have always been amazed at the way an ordinary observer lends so much more credence and attaches so much more importance to waking events than to those occurring in dreams, It is because man, when he ceases to sleep, is above all the plaything of his memory, and in its normal state memory takes pleasure in weakly retracing for him the circumstances of the dream, in stripping it of any real importance, and in dismissing the only determinant from the point where he thinks he has left it a few hours before: this firm hope, this concern, He is under the impression of continuing something that is worthwhile, Thus the dream finds itself reduced to a mere parenthesis, as is the night, And, like the night, dreams generally contribute little to furthering our understanding, This curious state of affairs seems to me to call for certain reflections:1) Within the limits where they operate (or are thought to operate) dreams give every evidence of being continuous and show signs of organization, Memory alone arrogates to itself the right to excerpt from dreams, to ignore the transitions, and to depict for us rather a series of dreams than the dream itself, By the same token, at any given moment we have only a distinct notion of realities, the coordination of which is a question of will,* (Account must be taken of the depth of the dream, For the most part I retain only what I can glean from its most superficial layers, What I most enjoy contemplating about a dream is everything that sinks back below the surface in a waking state, everything I have forgotten about my activities in the course of the preceding day, dark foliage, stupid branches, In "reality," likewise, I prefer to fall,) What is worth noting is that nothing allows us to presuppose a greater dissipation of the elements of which the dream is constituted, I am sorry to have to speak about it according to a formula which in principle excludes the dream, When will we have sleeping logicians, sleeping philosophers, I would like to sleep, in order to surrender myself to the dreamers, the way I surrender myself to those who read me with eyes wide open; in order to stop imposing, in this realm, the conscious rhythm of my thought, Perhaps my dream last night follows that of the night before, and will be continued the next night, with an exemplary strictness, It's quite possible, as the saying goes, And since it has not been proved in the slightest that, in doing so, the "reality" with which I am kept busy continues to exist in the state of dream, that it does not sink back down into the immemorial, why should I not grant to dreams what I occasionally refuse reality, that is, this value of certainty in itself which, in its own time, is not open to my repudiation, Why should I not expect from the sign of the dream more than I expect from a degree of consciousness which is daily more acute, Can't the dream also be used in solving the fundamental questions of life, Are these questions the same in one case as in the other and, in the dream, do these questions already exist, Is the dream any less restrictive or punitive than the rest, I am growing old and, more than that reality to which I believe I subject myself, it is perhaps the dream, the difference with which I treat the dream, which makes me grow old,2) Let me come back again to the waking state, I have no choice but to consider it a phenomenon of interference, Not only does the mind display, in this state, a strange tendency to lose its bearings (as evidenced by the slips and mistakes the secrets of which are just beginning to be revealed to us), but, what is more, it does not appear that, when the mind is functioning normally, it really responds to anything but the suggestions which come to it from the depths of that dark night to which I commend it, However conditioned it may be, its balance is relative, It scarcely dares express itself and, if it does, it confines itself to verifying that such and such an idea, or such and such a woman, has made an impression on it, What impression it would be hard pressed to say, by which it reveals the degree of its subjectivity, and nothing more, This idea, this woman, disturb it, they tend to make it less severe, What they do is isolate the mind for a second from its solvent and spirit it to heaven, as the beautiful precipitate it can be, that it is, When all else fails, it then calls upon chance, a divinity even more obscure than the others to whom it ascribes all its aberrations, Who can say to me that the angle by which that idea which affects it is offered, that what it likes in the eye of that woman is not precisely what links it to its dream, binds it to those fundamental facts which, through its own fault, it has lost, And if things were different, what might it be capable of, I would like to provide it with the key to this corridor,3) The mind of the man who dreams is fully satisfied by what happens to him, The agonizing question of possibility is no longer pertinent, Kill, fly faster, love to your heart's content, And if you should die, are you not certain of reawaking among the dead, Let yourself be carried along, events will not tolerate your interference, You are nameless, The ease of everything is priceless,What reason, I ask, a reason so much vaster than the other, makes dreams seem so natural and allows me to welcome unreservedly a welter of episodes so strange that they could confound me now as I write, And yet I can believe my eyes, my ears; this great day has arrived, this beast has spoken,If man's awaking is harder, if it breaks the spell too abruptly, it is because he has been led to make for himself too impoverished a notion of atonement,4) From the moment when it is subjected to a methodical examination, when, by means yet to be determined, we succeed in recording the contents of dreams in their entirety (and that presupposes a discipline of memory spanning generations; but let us nonetheless begin by noting the most salient facts), when its graph will expand with unparalleled volume and regularity, we may hope that the mysteries which really are not will give way to the great Mystery, I believe in the future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality, if one may so speak, It is in quest of this surreality that I am going, certain not to find it but too unmindful of my death not to calculate to some slight degree the joys of its possession,A story is told according to which Saint-Pol-Roux, in times gone by, used to have a notice posted on the door of his manor house in Camaret, every evening before he went to sleep, which read: THE POET IS WORKING,A great deal more could be said, but in passing I merely wanted to touch upon a subject which in itself would require a very long and much more detailed discussion; I shall come back to it, At this juncture, my intention was merely to mark a point by noting the hate of the marvelous which rages in certain men, this absurdity beneath which they try to bury it, Let us not mince words: the marvelous is always beautiful, anything marvelous is beautiful, in fact only the marvelous is beautiful, In the realm of literature, only the marvelous is capable of fecundating works which belong to an inferior category such as the novel, and generally speaking, anything that involves storytelling, Lewis' The Monk is an admirable proof of this, It is infused throughout with the presence of the marvelous, Long before the author has freed his main characters from all temporal constraints, one feels them ready to act with an unprecedented pride, This passion for eternity with which they are constantly stirred lends an unforgettable intensity to their torments, and to mine, I mean that this book, from beginning to end, and in the purest way imaginable, exercises an exalting effect only upon that part of the mind which aspires to leave the earth and that, stripped of an insignificant part of its plot, which belongs to the period in which it was written, it constitutes a paragon of precision and innocent grandeur,* (What is admirable about the fantastic is that there is no longer anything fantastic: there is only the real,) It seems to me none better has been done, and that the character of Mathilda in particular is the most moving creation that one can credit to this figurative fashion in literature, She is less a character than a continual temptation, And if a character is not a temptation, what is he, An extreme temptation, she, In The Monk the "nothing is impossible for him who dares try" gives it its full, convincing measure, Ghosts play a logical role in the book, since the critical mind does not seize them in order to dispute them, Ambrosio's punishment is likewise treated in a legitimate manner, since it is finally accepted by the critical faculty as a natural denouement,It may seem arbitrary on my part, when discussing the marvelous, to choose this model, from which both the Nordic literatures and Oriental literatures have borrowed time and time again, not to mention the religious literatures of every country, This is because most of the examples which these literatures could have furnished me with are tainted by puerility, for the simple reason that they are addressed to children, At an early age children are weaned on the marvelous, and later on they fail to retain a sufficient virginity of mind to thoroughly enjoy fairy tales, No matter how charming they may be, a grown man would think he were reverting to childhood by nourishing himself on fairy tales, and I am the first to admit that all such tales are not suitable for him, The fabric of adorable improbabilities must be made a trifle more subtle the older we grow, and we are still at the age of waiting for this kind of spider, But the faculties do not change radically, Fear, the attraction of the unusual, chance, the taste for things extravagant are all devices which we can always call upon without fear of deception, There are fairy tales to be written for adults, fairy tales still almost blue,The marvelous is not the same in every period of history: it partakes in some obscure way of a sort of general revelation only the fragments of which come down to us: they are the romantic ruins, the modern mannequin, or any other symbol capable of affecting the human sensibility for a period of time, In these areas which make us smile, there is still portrayed the incurable human restlessness, and this is why I take them into consideration and why I judge them inseparable from certain productions of genius which are, more than the others, painfully afflicted by them, They are Villon's gibbets, Racine's Greeks, Baudelaire's couches, They coincide with an eclipse of the taste I am made to endure, I whose notion of taste is the image of a big spot, Amid the bad taste of my time I strive to go further than anyone else, It would have been I, had I lived in 1820, I "the bleeding nun," I who would not have spared this cunning and banal "let us conceal" whereof the parodical Cuisin speaks, it would have been I, I who would have reveled in the enormous metaphors, as he says, all phases of the "silver disk," For today I think of a castle, half of which is not necessarily in ruins; this castle belongs to me, I picture it in a rustic setting, not far from Paris, The outbuildings are too numerous to mention, and, as for the interior, it has been frightfully restored, in such manner as to leave nothing to be desired from the viewpoint of comfort, Automobiles are parked before the door, concealed by the shade of trees, A few of my friends are living here as permanent guests: there is Louis Aragon leaving; he only has time enough to say hello; Philippe Soupault gets up with the stars, and Paul Eluard, our great Eluard, has not yet come home, There are Robert Desnos and Roger Vitrac out on the grounds poring over an ancient edict on duelling; Georges Auric, Jean Paulhan; Max Morise, who rows so well, and Benjamin Péret, busy with his equations with birds; and Joseph Delteil; and Jean Carrive; and Georges Limbour, and Georges Limbours (there is a whole hedge of Georges Limbours); and Marcel Noll; there is T, Fraenkel waving to us from his captive balloon, Georges Malkine, Antonin Artaud, Francis Gérard, Pierre Naville, J,-A, Boiffard, and after them Jacques Baron and his brother, handsome and cordial, and so many others besides, and gorgeous women, I might add, Nothing is too good for these young men, their wishes are, as to wealth, so many commands, Francis Picabia comes to pay us a call, and last week, in the hall of mirrors, we received a certain Marcel Duchamp whom we had not hitherto known, Picasso goes hunting in the neighborhood, The spirit of demoralization has elected domicile in the castle, and it is with it we have to deal every time it is a question of contact with our fellowmen, but the doors are always open, and one does not begin by "thanking" everyone, you know, Moreover, the solitude is vast, we don't often run into one another, And anyway, isn't what matters that we be the masters of ourselves, the masters of women, and of love too,I shall be proved guilty of poetic dishonesty: everyone will go parading about saying that I live on the rue Fontaine and that he will have none of the water that flows therefrom, To be sure, But is he certain that this castle into which I cordially invite him is an image, What if this castle really existed, My guests are there to prove it does; their whim is the luminous road that leads to it, We really live by our fantasies when we give free reign to them, And how could what one might do bother the other, there, safely sheltered from the sentimental pursuit and at the trysting place of opportunities, Man proposes and disposes, He and he alone can determine whether he is completely master of himself, that is, whether he maintains the body of his desires, daily more formidable, in a state of anarchy, Poetry teaches him to, It bears within itself the perfect compensation for the miseries we endure, It can also be an organizer, if ever, as the result of a less intimate disappointment, we contemplate taking it seriously, The time is coming when it decrees the end of money and by itself will break the bread of heaven for the earth, There will still be gatherings on the public squares, and movements you never dared hope participate in, Farewell to absurd choices, the dreams of dark abyss, rivalries, the prolonged patience, the flight of the seasons, the artificial order of ideas, the ramp of danger, time for everything, May you only take the trouble to practice poetry, Is it not incumbent upon us, who are already living off it, to try and impose what we hold to be our case for further inquiry,It matters not whether there is a certain disproportion between this defense and the illustration that will follow it, It was a question of going back to the sources of poetic imagination and, what is more, of remaining there, Not that I pretend to have done so, It requires a great deal of fortitude to try to set up one's abode in these distant regions where everything seems at first to be so awkward and difficult, all the more so if one wants to try to take someone there, Besides, one is never sure of really being there, If one is going to all that trouble, one might as well stop off somewhere else, Be that as it may, the fact is that the way to these regions is clearly marked, and that to attain the true goal is now merely a matter of the travelers' ability to endure, We are all more or less aware of the road traveled, I was careful to relate, in the course of a study of the case of Robert Desnos entitled ENTRÉE DES MÉDIUMS,* (See Les Pas perdus, published by N,R,F,) that I had been led to" concentrate my attention on the more or less partial sentences which, when one is quite alone and on the verge of falling asleep, become perceptible for the mind without its being possible to discover what provoked them," I had then just attempted the poetic adventure with the minimum of risks, that is, my aspirations were the same as they are today but I trusted in the slowness of formulation to keep me from useless contacts, contacts of which I completely disapproved, This attitude involved a modesty of thought certain vestiges of which I still retain, At the end of my life, I shall doubtless manage to speak with great effort the way people speak, to apologize for my voice and my few remaining gestures, The virtue of the spoken word (and the written word all the more so) seemed to me to derive from the faculty of foreshortening in a striking manner the exposition (since there was exposition) of a small number of facts, poetic or other, of which I made myself the substance, I had come to the conclusion that Rimbaud had not proceeded any differently, I was composing, with a concern for variety that deserved better, the final poems of Mont de piété, that is, I managed to extract from the blank lines of this book an incredible advantage, These lines were the closed eye to the operations of thought that I believed I was obliged to keep hidden from the reader, It was not deceit on my part, but my love of shocking the reader, I had the illusion of a possible complicity, which I had more and more difficulty giving up, I had begun to cherish words excessively for the space they allow around them, for their tangencies with countless other words which I did not utter, The poem BLACK FOREST derives precisely from this state of mind, It took me six months to write it, and you may take my word for it that I did not rest a single day, But this stemmed from the opinion I had of myself in those days, which was high, please don't judge me too harshly, I enjoy these stupid confessions, At that point cubist pseudo-poetry was trying to get a foothold, but it had emerged defenseless from Picasso's brain, and I was thought to be as dull as dishwater (and still am), I had a sneaking suspicion, moreover, that from the viewpoint of poetry I was off on the wrong road, but I hedged my bet as best I could, defying lyricism with salvos of definitions and formulas (the Dada phenomena were waiting in the wings, ready to come on stage) and pretending to search for an application of poetry to advertising (I went so far as to claim that the world would end, not with a good book but with a beautiful advertisement for heaven or for hell),In those days, a man at least as boring as I, Pierre Reverdy, was writing:The image is a pure creation of the mind,It cannot be born from a comparison but from a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities,The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true, the stronger the image will be -- the greater its emotional power and poetic reality,* (Nord-Sud, March 1918)These words, however sibylline for the uninitiated, were extremely revealing, and I pondered them for a long time, But the image eluded me, Reverdy's aesthetic, a completely a posteriori aesthetic, led me to mistake the effects for the causes, It was in the midst of all this that I renounced irrevocably my point of view, One evening, therefore, before I fell asleep, I perceived, so clearly articulated that it was impossible to change a word, but nonetheless removed from the sound of any voice, a rather strange phrase which came to me without any apparent relationship to the events in which, my consciousness agrees, I was then involved, a phrase which seemed to me insistent, a phrase, if I may be so bold, which was knocking at the window, I took cursory note of it and prepared to move on when its organic character caught my attention, Actually, this phrase astonished me: unfortunately I cannot remember it exactly, but it was something like: "There is a man cut in two by the window," but there could be no question of ambiguity, accompanied as it was by the faint visual image* (Were I a painter, this visual depiction would doubtless have become more important for me than the other, It was most certainly my previous predispositions which decided the matter, Since that day, I have had occasion to concentrate my attention voluntarily on similar apparitions, and I know they are fully as clear as auditory phenomena, With a pencil and white sheet of paper to hand, I could easily trace their outlines, Here again it is not a matter of drawing, but simply of tracing, I could thus depict a tree, a wave, a musical instrument, all manner of things of which I am presently incapable of providing even the roughest sketch, I would plunge into it, convinced that I would find my way again, in a maze of lines which at first glance would seem to be going nowhere, And, upon opening my eyes, I would get the very strong impression of something "never seen," The proof of what I am saying has been provided many times by Robert Desnos: to be convinced, one has only to leaf through the pages of issue number 36 of Feuilles libres which contains several of his drawings (Romeo and Juliet, A Man Died This Morning, etc,) which were taken by this magazine as the drawings of a madman and published as such,) of a man walking cut half way up by a window perpendicular to the axis of his body, Beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt, what I saw was the simple reconstruction in space of a man leaning out a window, But this window having shifted with the man, I realized that I was dealing with an image of a fairly rare sort, and all I could think of was to incorporate it into my material for poetic construction, No sooner had I granted it this capacity than it was in fact succeeded by a whole series of phrases, with only brief pauses between them, which surprised me only slightly less and left me with the impression of their being so gratuitous that the control I had then exercised upon myself seemed to me illusory and all I could think of was putting an end to the interminable quarrel raging within me,* (Knut Hamsum ascribes this sort of revelation to which I had been subjected as deriving from hunger, and he may not be wrong, (The fact is I did not eat every day during that period of my life), Most certainly the manifestations that he describes in these terms are clearly the same:"The following day I awoke at an early hour, It was still dark, My eyes had been open for a long time when I heard the clock in the apartment above strike five, I wanted to go back to sleep, but I couldn't; I was wide awake and a thousand thoughts were crowding through my mind,"Suddenly a few good fragments came to mind, quite suitable to be used in a rough draft, or serialized; all of a sudden I found, quite by chance, beautiful phrases, phrases such as I had never written, I repeated them to myself slowly, word by word; they were excellent, And there were still more coming, I got up and picked up a pencil and some paper that were on a table behind my bed, It was as though some vein had burst within me, one word followed another, found its proper place, adapted itself to the situation, scene piled upon scene, the action unfolded, one retort after another welled up in my mind, I was enjoying myself immensely, Thoughts came to me so rapidly and continued to flow so abundantly that I lost a whole host of delicate details, because my pencil could not keep up with them, and yet I went as fast as I could, my hand in constant motion, I did not lose a minute, The sentences continued to well up within me, I was pregnant with my subject," Apollinaire asserted that Chirico's first paintings were done under the influence of cenesthesic disorders (migraines, colics, etc,),) Completely occupied as I still was with Freud at that time, and familiar as I was with his methods of examination which I had some slight occasion to use on some patients during the war, I resolved to obtain from myself what we were trying to obtain from them, namely, a monologue spoken as rapidly as possible without any intervention on the part of the critical faculties, a monologue consequently unencumbered by the slightest inhibition and which was, as closely as possible, akin to spoken thought, It had seemed to me, and still does -- the way in which the phrase about the man cut in two had come to me is an indication of it -- that the speed of thought is no greater than the speed of speech, and that thought does not necessarily defy language, nor even the fast-moving pen, It was in this frame of mind that Philippe Soupault -- to whom I had confided these initial conclusions - and I decided to blacken some paper, with a praiseworthy disdain for what might result from a literary point of view, The ease of execution did the rest, By the end of the first day we were able to read to ourselves some fifty or so pages obtained in this manner, and begin to compare our results, All in all, Soupault's pages and mine proved to be remarkably similar: the same overconstruction, shortcomings of a similar nature, but also, on both our parts, the illusion of an extraordinary verve, a great deal of emotion, a considerable choice of images of a quality such that we would not have been capable of preparing a single one in longhand, a very special picturesque quality and, here and there, a strong comical effect, The only difference between our two texts seemed to me to derive essentially from our respective tempers, Soupault's being less static than mine, and, if he does not mind my offering this one slight criticism, from the fact that he had made the error of putting a few words by way of titles at the top of certain pages, I suppose in a spirit of mystification, On the other hand, I must give credit where credit is due and say that he constantly and vigorously opposed any effort to retouch or correct, however slightly, any passage of this kind which seemed to me unfortunate, In this he was, to be sure, absolutely right,* (I believe more and more in the infallibility of my thought with respect to myself, and this is too fair, Nonetheless, with this thought-writing, where one is at the mercy of the first outside distraction, "ebullutions" can occur, It would be inexcusable for us to pretend otherwise, By definition, thought is strong, and incapable of catching itself in error, The blame for these obvious weaknesses must be placed on suggestions that come to it from without,) It is, in fact, difficult to appreciate fairly the various elements present: one may even go so far as to say that it is impossible to appreciate them at a first reading, To you who write, these elements are, on the surface, as strange to you as they are to anyone else, and naturally you are wary of them, Poetically speaking, what strikes you about them above all is their extreme degree of immediate absurdity, the quality of this absurdity, upon closer scrutiny, being to give way to everything admissible, everything legitimate in the world: the disclosure of a certain number of properties and of facts no less objective, in the final analysis, than the others,In homage to Guillaume Apollinaire, who had just died and who, on several occasions, seemed to us to have followed a discipline of this kind, without however having sacrificed to it any mediocre literary means, Soupault and I baptized the new mode of pure expression which we had at our disposal and which we wished to pass on to our friends, by the name of SURREALISM, I believe that there is no point today in dwelling any further on this word and that the meaning we gave it initially has generally prevailed over its Apollinarian sense, To be even fairer, we could probably have taken over the word SUPERNATURALISM employed by Gérard de Nerval in his dedication to the Filles de feu,* (And also by Thomas Carlyle in Sartor Resartus ([Book III] Chapter VIII, "Natural Supernaturalism"), 1833-34,) It appears, in fact, that Nerval possessed to a tee the spirit with which we claim a kinship, Apollinaire having possessed, on the contrary, naught but the letter, still imperfect, of Surrealism, having shown himself powerless to give a valid theoretical idea of it, Here are two passages by Nerval which seem to me to be extremely significant in this respect:I am going to explain to you, my dear Dumas, the phenomenon of which you have spoken a short while ago, There are, as you know, certain storytellers who cannot invent without identifying with the characters their imagination has dreamt up, You may recall how convincingly our old friend Nodier used to tell how it had been his misfortune during the Revolution to be guillotined; one became so completely convinced of what he was saying that one began to wonder how he had managed to have his head glued back on,And since you have been indiscreet enough to quote one of the sonnets composed in this SUPERNATURALISTIC dream-state, as the Germans would call it, you will have to hear them all, You will find them at the end of the volume, They are hardly any more obscure than Hegel's metaphysics or Swedenborg's MEMORABILIA, and would lose their charm if they were explained, if such were possible; at least admit the worth of the expression,** (See also L'Idéoréalisme by Saint-Pol-Roux,) Those who might dispute our right to employ the term SURREALISM in the very special sense that we understand it are being extremely dishonest, for there can be no doubt that this word had no currency before we came along, Therefore, I am defining it once and for all:SURREALISM, n, Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express -- verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner -- the actual functioning of thought, Dictated by the thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern,ENCYCLOPEDIA, Philosophy, Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations, in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought, It tends to ruin once and for all all other psychic mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving all the principal problems of life, The following have performed acts of ABSOLUTE SURREALISM: Messrs, Aragon, Baron, Boiffard, Breton, Carrive, Crevel, Delteil, Desnos, Eluard, Gérard, Limbour, Malkine, Morise, Naville, Noll, Péret, Picon, Soupault, Vitrac,They seem to be, up to the present time, the only ones, and there would be no ambiguity about it were it not for the case of Isidore Ducasse, about whom I lack information, And, of course, if one is to judge them only superficially by their results, a good number of poets could pass for Surrealists, beginning with Dante and, in his finer moments, Shakespeare, In the course of the various attempts I have made to reduce what is, by breach of trust, called genius, I have found nothing which in the final analysis can be attributed to any other method than that,Young's Nights are Surrealist from one end to the other; unfortunately it is a priest who is speaking, a bad priest no doubt, but a priest nonetheless,Swift is Surrealist in malice,Sade is Surrealist in sadism,Chateaubriand is Surrealist in exoticism,Constant is Surrealist in politics,Hugo is Surrealist when he isn't stupid,Desbordes-Valmore is Surrealist in love,Bertrand is Surrealist in the past,Rabbe is Surrealist in death,Poe is Surrealist in adventure,Baudelaire is Surrealist in morality,Rimbaud is Surrealist in the way he lived, and elsewhere,Mallarmé is Surrealist when he is confiding,Jarry is Surrealist in absinthe,Nouveau is Surrealist in the kiss,Saint-Pol-Roux is Surrealist in his use of symbols,Fargue is Surrealist in the atmosphere,Vaché is Surrealist in me,Reverdy is Surrealist at home,Saint-Jean-Perse is Surrealist at a distance,Roussel is Surrealist as a storyteller,Etc,I would like to stress the point: they are not always Surrealists, in that I discern in each of them a certain number of preconceived ideas to which -- very naively, -- they hold, They hold to them because they had not heard the Surrealist voice, the one that continues to preach on the eve of death and above the storms, because they did not want to serve simply to orchestrate the marvelous score, They were instruments too full of pride, and this is why they have not always produced a harmonious sound,* (I could say the same of a number of philosophers and painters, including, among the latter, Uccello, from painters of the past, and, in the modern era, Seurat, Gustave Moreau, Matisse (in "La Musique," for example), Derain, Picasso, (by far the most pure), Braque, Duchamp, Picabia, Chirico (so admirable for so long), Klee, Man Ray, Max Ernst, and, one so close to us, André Masson,)But we, who have made no effort whatsoever to filter, who in our works have made ourselves into simple receptacles of so many echoes, modest recording instruments who are not mesmerized by the drawings we are making, perhaps we serve an even nobler cause, Thus do we render with integrity the "talent" which has been lent to us, You might as well speak of the talent of this platinum ruler, this mirror, this door, and of the sky, if you like,We do not have any talent; ask Philippe Soupault:"Anatomical products of manufacture and low-income dwellings will destroy the tallest cities,"Ask Roger Vitrac:"No sooner had I called forth the marble-admiral than he turned on his heel like a horse which rears at the sight of the North star and showed me, in the plane of his two-pointed cocked hat, a region where I was to spend my life,"Ask Paul Eluard:"This is an oft-told tale that I tell, a famous poem that I reread: I am leaning against a wall, with my verdant ears and my lips burned to a crisp,"Ask Max Morise:"The bear of the caves and his friend the bittern, the vol-au-vent and his valet the wind, the Lord Chancellor with his Lady, the scarecrow for sparrows and his accomplice the sparrow, the test tube and his daughter the needle, this carnivore and his brother the carnival, the sweeper and his monocle, the Mississippi and its little dog, the coral and its jug of milk, the Miracle and its Good Lord, might just as well go and disappear from the surface of the sea,"Ask Joseph Delteil:"Alas, I believe in the virtue of birds, And a feather is all it takes to make me die laughing,"Ask Louis Aragon:"During a short break in the party, as the players were gathering around a bowl of flaming punch, I asked a tree if it still had its red ribbon,"And ask me, who was unable to keep myself from writing the serpentine, distracting lines of this preface, Ask Robert Desnos, he who, more than any of us, has perhaps got closest to the Surrealist truth, he who, in his still unpublished works* (NOUVELLES HÉBRIDES, DÉSORDRE FORMEL, DEUIL POUR DEUIL,) and in the course of the numerous experiments he has been a party to, has fully justified the hope I placed in Surrealism and leads me to believe that a great deal more will still come of it, Desnos speaks Surrealist at will, His extraordinary agility in orally following his thought is worth as much to us as any number of splendid speeches which are lost, Desnos having better things to do than record them, He reads himself like an open book, and does nothing to retain the pages, which fly away in the windy wake of his life, After you have settled yourself in a place as favorable as possible to the concentration of your mind upon itself, have writing materials brought to you, Put yourself in as passive, or receptive, a state of mind as you can, Forget about your genius, your talents, and the talents of everyone else, Keep reminding yourself that literature is one of the saddest roads that leads to everything, Write quickly, without any preconceived subject, fast enough so that you will not remember what you're writing and be tempted to reread what you have written, The first sentence will come spontaneously, so compelling is the truth that with every passing second there is a sentence unknown to our consciousness which is only crying out to be heard, It is somewhat of a problem to form an opinion about the next sentence; it doubtless partakes both of our conscious activity and of the other, if one agrees that the fact of having written the first entails a minimum of perception, This should be of no importance to you, however; to a large extent, this is what is most interesting and intriguing about the Surrealist game, The fact still remains that punctuation no doubt resists the absolute continuity of the flow with which we are concerned, although it may seem as necessary as the arrangement of knots in a vibrating cord, Go on as long as you like, Put your trust in the inexhaustible nature of the murmur, If silence threatens to settle in if you should ever happen to make a mistake -- a mistake, perhaps due to carelessness -- break off without hesitation with an overly clear line, Following a word the origin of which seems suspicious to you, place any letter whatsoever, the letter "l" for example, always the letter "l," and bring the arbitrary back by making this letter the first of the following word,How not to be bored any longer when with othersThis is very difficult, Don't be at home for anyone, and occasionally, when no one has forced his way in, interrupting you in the midst of your Surrealist activity, and you, crossing your arms, say: "It doesn't matter, there are doubtless better things to do or not do, Interest in life is indefensible Simplicity, what is going on inside me, is still tiresome to me," or an other revolting banality,To make speechesJust prior to the elections, in the first country which deems it worthwhile to proceed in this kind of public expression of opinion, have yourself put on the ballot, Each of us has within himself the potential of an orator: multicolored loin cloths, glass trinkets of words, Through Surrealism he will take despair unawares in its poverty, One night, on a stage, he will, by himself, carve up the eternal heaven, that Peau de l'ours, He will promise so much that any promises he keeps will be a source of wonder and dismay, In answer to the claims of an entire people he will give a partial and ludicrous vote, He will make the bitterest enemies partake of a secret desire which will blow up the countries, And in this he will succeed simply by allowing himself to be moved by the immense word which dissolves into pity and revolves in hate, Incapable of failure, he will play on the velvet of all failures, He will be truly elected, and women will love him with an all-consuming passion,To write false novelsWhoever you may be, if the spirit moves you burn a few laurel leaves and, without wishing to tend this meager fire, you will begin to write a novel, Surrealism will allow you to: all you have to do is set the needle marked "fair" at "action," and the rest will follow naturally, Here are some characters rather different in appearance; their names in your handwriting are a question of capital letters, and they will conduct themselves with the same ease with respect to active verbs as does the impersonal pronoun "it" with respect to words such as "is raining," "is," "must," etc, They will command them, so to speak, and wherever observation, reflection, and the faculty of generalization prove to be of no help to you, you may rest assured that they will credit you with a thousand intentions you never had, Thus endowed with a tiny number of physical and moral characteristics, these beings who in truth owe you so little will thereafter deviate not one iota from a certain line of conduct about which you need not concern yourself any further, Out of this will result a plot more or less clever in appearance, justifying point by point this moving or comforting denouement about which you couldn't care less, Your false novel will simulate to a marvelous degree a real novel; you will be rich, and everyone will agree that "you've really got a lot of guts," since it's also in this region that this something is located,Of course, by an analogous method, and provided you ignore what you are reviewing, you can successfully devote yourself to false literary criticism,How to catch the eye of a womanyou pass in the street Against deathSurrealism will usher you into death, which is a secret society, It will glove your hand, burying therein the profound M with which the word Memory begins, Do not forget to make proper arrangements for your last will and testament: speaking personally, I ask that I be taken to the cemetery in a moving van, May my friends destroy every last copy of the printing of the Speech concerning the Modicum of Reality,Language has been given to man so that he may make Surrealist use of it, To the extent that he is required to make himself understood, he manages more or less to express himself, and by so doing to fulfill certain functions culled from among the most vulgar, Speaking, reading a letter, present no real problem for him, provided that, in so doing, he does not set himself a goal above the mean, that is, provided he confines himself to carrying on a conversation (for the pleasure of conversing) with someone, He is not worried about the words that are going to come, nor about the sentence which will follow after the sentence he is just completing, To a very simple question, he will be capable of making a lightning-like reply, In the absence of minor tics acquired through contact with others, he can without any ado offer an opinion on a limited number of subjects; for that he does not need to "count up to ten" before speaking or to formulate anything whatever ahead of time, Who has been able to convince him that this faculty of the first draft will only do him a disservice when he makes up his mind to establish more delicate relationships, There is no subject about which he should refuse to talk, to write about prolifically, All that results from listening to oneself, from reading what one has written, is the suspension of the occult, that admirable help, I am in no hurry to understand myself (basta, I shall always understand myself), If such and such a sentence of mine turns out to be somewhat disappointing, at least momentarily, I place my trust in the following sentence to redeem its sins; I carefully refrain from starting it over again or polishing it, The only thing that might prove fatal to me would be the slightest loss of impetus, Words, groups of words which follow one another, manifest among themselves the greatest solidarity, It is not up to me to favor one group over the other, It is up to a miraculous equivalent to intervene -- and intervene it does,Not only does this unrestricted language, which I am trying to render forever valid, which seems to me to adapt itself to all of life's circumstances, not only does this language not deprive me of any of my means, on the contrary it lends me an extraordinary lucidity, and it does so in an area where I least expected it, I shall even go so far as to maintain that it instructs me and, indeed, I have had occasion to use surreally words whose meaning I have forgotten, I was subsequently able to verify that the way in which I had used them corresponded perfectly with their definition, This would leave one to believe that we do not "learn," that all we ever do is "relearn," There are felicitous turns of speech that I have thus familiarized myself with, And I am not talking about the poetic consciousness of objects which I have been able to acquire only after a spiritual contact with them repeated a thousand times over,The forms of Surrealist language adapt themselves best to dialogue, Here, two thoughts confront each other; while one is being delivered, the other is busy with it; but how is it busy with it, To assume that it incorporates it within itself would be tantamount to admitting that there is a time during which it is possible for it to live completely off that other thought, which is highly unlikely, And, in fact, the attention it pays is completely exterior; it has only time enough to approve or reject -- generally reject -- with all the consideration of which man is capable, This mode of language, moreover, does not allow the heart of the matter to be plumbed, My attention, prey to an entreaty which it cannot in all decency reject, treats the opposing thought as an enemy; in ordinary conversation, it "takes it up" almost always on the words, the figures of speech, it employs; it puts me in a position to turn it to good advantage in my reply by distorting them, This is true to such a degree that in certain pathological states of mind, where the sensorial disorders occupy the patient's complete attention, he limits himself, while continuing to answer the questions, to seizing the last word spoken in his presence or the last portion of the Surrealist sentence some trace of which he finds in his mind,Q, "How old are you," A, "You," (Echolalia,)Q, "What is your name," A, "Forty-five houses," (Ganser syndrome, or beside-the-point replies,)There is no conversation in which some trace of this disorder does not occur, The effort to be social which dictates it and the considerable practice we have at it are the only things which enable us to conceal it temporarily, It is also the great weakness of the book that it is in constant conflict with its best, by which I mean the most demanding, readers, In the very short dialogue that I concocted above between the doctor and the madman, it was in fact the madman who got the better of the exchange, Because, through his replies, he obtrudes upon the attention of the doctor examining him -- and because he is not the person asking the questions, Does this mean that his thought at this point is stronger, Perhaps, He is free not to care any longer about his age or name,Poetic Surrealism, which is the subject of this study, has focused its efforts up to this point on reestablishing dialogue in its absolute truth, by freeing both interlocutors from any obligations and politeness, Each of them simply pursues his soliloquy without trying to derive any special dialectical pleasure from it and without trying to impose anything whatsoever upon his neighbor, The remarks exchanged are not, as is generally the case, meant to develop some thesis, however unimportant it may be; they are as disaffected as possible, As for the reply that they elicit, it is, in principle, totally indifferent to the personal pride of the person speaking, The words, the images are only so many springboards for the mind of the listener, In Les Champs magnétiques, the first purely Surrealist work, this is the way in which the pages grouped together under the title Barrières must be conceived of -- pages wherein Soupault and I show ourselves to be impartial interlocutors, Surrealism does not allow those who devote themselves to it to forsake it whenever they like, There is every reason to believe that it acts on the mind very much as drugs do; like drugs, it creates a certain state of need and can push man to frightful revolts, It also is, if you like, an artificial paradise, and the taste one has for it derives from Baudelaire's criticism for the same reason as the others, Thus the analysis of the mysterious effects and special pleasures it can produce -- in many respects Surrealism occurs as a new vice which does not necessarily seem to be restricted to the happy few; like hashish, it has the ability to satisfy all manner of tastes -- such an analysis has to be included in the present study,1, It is true of Surrealist images as it is of opium images that man does not evoke them; rather they "come to him spontaneously, despotically, He cannot chase them away; for the will is powerless now and no longer controls the faculties,"* (Baudelaire,) It remains to be seen whether images have ever been "evoked," If one accepts, as I do, Reverdy's definition it does not seem possible to bring together, voluntarily, what he calls "two distant realities," The juxtaposition is made or not made, and that is the long and the short of it, Personally, I absolutely refuse to believe that, in Reverdy's work, images such asIn the brook, there is a song that flowsor:Day unfolded like a white tableclothor:The world goes back into a sackreveal the slightest degree of premeditation, In my opinion, it is erroneous to claim that "the mind has grasped the relationship" of two realities in the presence of each other, First of all, it has seized nothing consciously, It is, as it were, from the fortuitous juxtaposition of the two terms that a particular light has sprung, the light of the image, to which we are infinitely sensitive, The value of the image depends upon the beauty of the spark obtained; it is, consequently, a function of the difference of potential between the two conductors, When the difference exists only slightly, as in a comparison,* (Compare the image in the work of Jules Renard,) the spark is lacking, Now, it is not within man's power, so far as I can tell, to effect the juxtaposition of two realities so far apart, The principle of the association of ideas, such as we conceive of it, militates against it, Or else we would have to revert to an elliptical art, which Reverdy deplores as much as I, We are therefore obliged to admit that the two terms of the image are not deduced one from the other by the mind for the specific purpose of producing the spark, that they are the simultaneous products of the activity I call Surrealist, reason's role being limited to taking note of, and appreciating, the luminous phenomenon,And just as the length of the spark increases to the extent that it occurs in rarefied gases, the Surrealist atmosphere created by automatic writing, which I have wanted to put within the reach of everyone, is especially conducive to the production of the most beautiful images, One can even go so far as to say that in this dizzying race the images appear like the only guideposts of the mind, By slow degrees the mind becomes convinced of the supreme reality of these images, At first limiting itself to submitting to them, it soon realizes that they flatter its reason, and increase its knowledge accordingly, The mind becomes aware of the limitless expanses wherein its desires are made manifest, where the pros and cons are constantly consumed, where its obscurity does not betray it, It goes forward, borne by these images which enrapture it, which scarcely leave it any time to blow upon the fire in its fingers, This is the most beautiful night of all, the lightning-filled night: day, compared to it, is night,The countless kinds of Surrealist images would require a classification which I do not intend to make today, To group them according to their particular affinities would lead me far afield; what I basically want to mention is their common virtue, For me, their greatest virtue, I must confess, is the one that is arbitrary to the highest degree, the one that takes the longest time to translate into practical language, either because it contains an immense amount of seeming contradiction or because one of its terms is strangely concealed; or because, presenting itself as something sensational, it seems to end weakly (because it suddenly closes the angle of its compass), or because it derives from itself a ridiculous formal justification, or because it is of a hallucinatory kind, or because it very naturally gives to the abstract the mask of the concrete, or the opposite, or because it implies the negation of some elementary physical property, or because it provokes laughter, Here, in order, are a few examples of it:The ruby of champagne, (LAUTRÉAMONT)Beautiful as the law of arrested development of the breast in adults, whose propensity to growth is not in proportion to the quantity of molecules that their organism assimilates, (LAUTRÉAMONT)A church stood dazzling as a bell, (PHILIPPE SOUPAULT)In Rrose Sélavy's sleep there is a dwarf issued from a well who comes to eat her bread at night, (ROBERT DESNOS)On the bridge the dew with the head of a tabby cat lulls itself to sleep, (ANDRÉ BRETON)A little to the left, in my firmament foretold, I see -- but it's doubtless but a mist of blood and murder -- the gleaming glass of liberty's disturbances, (LOUIS ARAGON)In the forest aflameThe lions were fresh, (ROBERT VITRAC)The color of a woman's stockings is not necessarily in the likeness of her eyes, which led a philosopher who it is pointless to mention, to say: "Cephalopods have more reasons to hate progress than do quadrupeds," (MAX MORISE)1st, Whether we like it or not, there is enough there to satisfy several demands of the mind, All these images seem to attest to the fact that the mind is ripe for something more than the benign joys it allows itself in general, This is the only way it has of turning to its own advantage the ideal quantity of events with which it is entrusted,* (Let us no forget that, according to Novalis' formula, "there are series of events which run parallel to real events, Men and circumstances generally modify the ideal train of circumstances, so that is seems imperfect; and their consequences are also equally imperfect, Thus it was with the Reformation; instead of Protestantism, we got Lutheranism,") These images show it the extent of its ordinary dissipation and the drawbacks that it offers for it, In the final analysis, it's not such a bad thing for these images to upset the mind, for to upset the mind is to put it in the wrong, The sentences I quote make ample provision for this, But the mind which relishes them draws therefrom the conviction that it is on the right track; on its own, the mind is incapable of finding itself guilty of cavil; it has nothing to fear, since, moreover, it attempts to embrace everything,2nd, The mind which plunges into Surrealism relives with glowing excitement the best part of its childhood, For such a mind, it is similar to the certainty with which a person who is drowning reviews once more, in the space of less than a second, all the insurmountable moments of his life, Some may say to me that the parallel is not very encouraging, But I have no intention of encouraging those who tell me that, From childhood memories, and from a few others, there emanates a sentiment of being unintegrated, and then later of having gone astray, which I hold to be the most fertile that exists, It is perhaps childhood that comes closest to one's "real life"; childhood beyond which man has at his disposal, aside from his laissez-passer, only a few complimentary tickets; childhood where everything nevertheless conspires to bring about the effective, risk-free possession of oneself, Thanks to Surrealism, it seems that opportunity knocks a second time, It is as though we were still running toward our salvation, or our perdition, In the shadow we again see a precious terror, Thank God, it's still only Purgatory, With a shudder, we cross what the occultists call dangerous territory, In my wake I raise up monsters that are lying in wait; they are not yet too ill-disposed toward me, and I am not lost, since I fear them, Here are "the elephants with the heads of women and the flying lions" which used to make Soupault and me tremble in our boots to meet, here is the "soluble fish" which still frightens me slightly, POISSON SOLUBLE, am I not the soluble fish, I was born under the sign of Pisces, and man is soluble in his thought, The flora and fauna of Surrealism are inadmissible,3rd, I do not believe in the establishment of a conventional Surrealist pattern any time in the near future, The characteristics common to all the texts of this kind, including those I have just cited and many others which alone could offer us a logical analysis and a careful grammatical analysis, do not preclude a certain evolution of Surrealist prose in time, Coming on the heels of a large number of essays I have written in this vein over the past five years, most of which I am indulgent enough to think are extremely disordered, the short anecdotes which comprise the balance of this volume offer me a glaring proof of what I am saying, I do not judge them to be any more worthless, because of that, in portraying for the reader the benefits which the Surrealist contribution is liable to make to his consciousness,Surrealist methods would, moreover, demand to beheard, Everything is valid when it comes to obtaining the desired suddenness from certain associations, The pieces of paper that Picasso and Braque insert into their work have the same value as the introduction of a platitude into a literary analysis of the most rigorous sort, It is even permissible to entitle POEM what we get from the most random assemblage possible (observe, if you will, the syntax) of headlines and scraps of headlines cut out of the newspapers: POEMA burst of laughterof sapphire in the island of CeylonThe most beautiful strawsHAVE A FADED COLORUNDER THE LOCKSon an isolated farmFROM DAY TO DAYthe

singerWHERE IS HE,in memoryin his houseAT THE SUITORS' BALLI doas I danceWhat people did, what they're going to do And we could offer many many more examples, The theater, philosophy, science, criticism would all succeed in finding their bearings there, I hasten to add that future Surrealist techniques do not interest me, Far more serious, in my opinion* (Whatever reservations I may be allowed to make concerning responsibility in general and the medico-legal considerations which determine an individual's degree of responsibility -- complete responsibility, irresponsibility, limited responsibility (sic) -- however difficult it may be for me to accept the principle of any kind of responsibility, I would like to know how the first punishable offenses, the Surrealist character of which will be clearly apparent, will be judged, Will the accused be acquitted, or will he merely be given the benefit of the doubt because of extenuating circumstances, It's a shame that the violation of the laws governing the Press is today scarcely repressed, for if it were not we would soon see a trial of this sort: the accused has published a book which is an outrage to public decency, Several of his "most respected and honorable" fellow citizens have lodged a complaint against him, and he is also charged with slander and libel, There are also all sorts of other charges against him, such as insulting and defaming the army, inciting to murder, rape, etc, The accused, moreover, wastes no time in agreeing with the accusers in "stigmatizing" most of the ideas expressed, His only defense is claiming that he does not consider himself to be the author of his book, said book being no more and no less than a Surrealist concoction which precludes any question of merit or lack of merit on the part of the person who signs it; further, that all he has done is copy a document without offering any opinion thereon, and that he is at least as foreign to the accused text as is the presiding judge himself,What is true for the publication of a book will also hold true for a whole host of other acts as soon as Surrealist methods begin to enjoy widespread favor, When that happens, a new morality must be substituted for the prevailing morality, the source of all our trials and tribulations,) -- I have intimated it often enough -- are the applications of Surrealism to action, To be sure, I do not believe in the prophetic nature of the Surrealist word, "It is the oracle, the things I say,"* (Rimbaud,) Yes, as much as I like, but what of the oracle itself,** (Still, STILL, We must absolutely get to the bottom of this, Today, June 8, 1924, about one o'clock, the voice whispered to me: "Béthune, Béthune," What did it mean, I have never been to Béthune, and have only the vaguest notion as to where it is located on the map of France, Béthune evokes nothing for me, not even a scene from The Three Musketeers, I should have left for Béthune, where perhaps there was something awaiting me; that would have been to simple, really, Someone told me they had read in a book by Chesterton about a detective who, in order to find someone he is looking for in a certain city, simply scoured from roof to cellar the houses which, from the outside, seemed somehow abnormal to him, were it only in some slight detail, This system is as good as any other,Similarly, in 1919, Soupault went into any number of impossible buildings to ask the concierge whether Philippe Soupault did in fact live there, He would not have been surprised, I suspect, by an affirmative reply, He would have gone and knocked on his door,) Men's piety does not fool me, The Surrealist voice that shook Cumae, Dodona, and Delphi is nothing more than the voice which dictates my less irascible speeches to me, My time must not be its time, why should this voice help me resolve the childish problem of my destiny, I pretend, unfortunately, to act in a world where, in order to take into account its suggestions, I would be obliged to resort to two kinds of interpreters, one to translate its judgements for me, the other, impossible to find, to transmit to my fellow men whatever sense I could make out of them, This world, in which I endure what I endure (don't go see), this modern world, I mean, what the devil do you want me to do with it, Perhaps the Surrealist voice will be stilled, I have given up trying to keep track of those who have disappeared, I shall no longer enter into, however briefly, the marvelous detailed description of my years and my days, I shall be like Nijinski who was taken last year to the Russian ballet and did not realize what spectacle it was he was seeing, I shall be alone, very alone within myself, indifferent to all the world's ballets, What I have done, what I have left undone, I give it to you, And ever since I have had a great desire to show forbearance to scientific musing, however unbecoming, in the final analysis, from every point of view, Radios, Fine, Syphilis, If you like, Photography, I don't see any reason why not, The cinema, Three cheers for darkened rooms, War, Gave us a good laugh, The telephone, Hello, Youth, Charming white hair, Try to make me say thank you: "Thank you," Thank you, If the common man has a high opinion of things which properly speaking belong to the realm of the laboratory, it is because such research has resulted in the manufacture of a machine or the discovery of some serum which the man in the street views as affecting him directly, He is quite sure that they have been trying to improve his lot, I am not quite sure to what extent scholars are motivated by humanitarian aims, but it does not seem to me that this factor constitutes a very marked degree of goodness, I am, of course, referring to true scholars and not to the vulgarizers and popularizers of all sorts who take out patents, In this realm as in any other, I believe in the pure Surrealist joy of the man who, forewarned that all others before him have failed, refuses to admit defeat, sets off from whatever point he chooses, along any other path save a reasonable one, and arrives wherever he can, Such and such an image, by which he deems it opportune to indicate his progress and which may result, perhaps, in his receiving public acclaim, is to me, I must confess, a matter of complete indifference, Nor is the material with which he must perforce encumber himself; his glass tubes or my metallic feathers, As for his method, I am willing to give it as much credit as I do mine, I have seen the inventor of the cutaneous plantar reflex at work; he manipulated his subjects without respite, it was much more than an "examination" he was employing; it was obvious that he was following no set plan, Here and there he formulated a remark, distantly, without nonetheless setting down his needle, while his hammer was never still, He left to others the futile task of curing patients, He was wholly consumed by and devoted to that sacred fever, Surrealism, such as I conceive of it, asserts our complete nonconformism clearly enough so that there can be no question of translating it, at the trial of the real world, as evidence for the defense, It could, on the contrary, only serve to justify the complete state of distraction which we hope to achieve here below, Kant's absentmindedness regarding women, Pasteur's absentmindedness about "grapes," Curie's absentmindedness with respect to vehicles, are in this regard profoundly symptomatic, This world is only very relatively in tune with thought, and incidents of this kind are only the most obvious episodes of a war in which I am proud to be participating,"Ce monde n'est que très relativement à la mesure de la pensée et les incidents de ce genre ne sont que les épisodes jusqu'ici les plus marquants d'une guerre d'indépendence à laquelle je me fais gloire de participer," Surrealism is the "invisible ray" which will one day enable us to win out over our opponents, "You are no longer trembling, carcass," This summer the roses are blue; the wood is of glass, The earth, draped in its verdant cloak, makes as little impression upon me as a ghost, It is living and ceasing to live which are imaginary solutions, Existence is elsewhere, Note: this version of the Manifesto of Surrealism was created in 1999 by surrealist,revolution@skymail,frIf I believe neither in Evil nor in Good, if I feel such a strong inclination to destroy, if there is nothing in the order of principles to which I can reasonably accede, the underlying reason is in my flesh,I destroy because for me everything that proceeds from reason is untrustworthy,I believe only in the evidence of what stirs my marrow, not in the evidence of what addresses itself to my reason, I have found levels in the realm of the nerve,I now feel capable of evaluating the evidence, There is for me an evidence in the realm of pure flesh which has nothing to do with the evidence of reason, The eternal conflict between reason and the heart is decided in my very flesh, but in my flesh irrigated by nerves, In the realm of the affective imponderable, the image provided by my nerves takes the form of the highest intellectuality, which I refuse to strip of its quality of intellectuality, And so it is that I watch the formation of a concept which carries within it the actual fulguration of things, a concept which arrives upon me with a sound of creation, No image satisfies me unless it is at the same time Knowledge, unless it carries with it its substance as well as its lucidity, My mind, exausted by discursive reason, wants to be caught up in the wheels of a new, an absolute gravitation, For me it is like a supreme reorganization in which only the laws of illogic participate, and in which there triumphs the discovery of a new Meaning, This Meaning which has been lost in the disorder of drugs and which presents the appearance of a profound intelligence to the contradictory phantasms of the sleep, This Meaning is a victory of the mind over itself, and although it is irreducible by reason, it exists, but only inside the mind, It is order, it is intelligence, it is the signification of chaos, But it does not accept this chaos as such, it interprets it, and because it interprets it, it loses it, It is the logic of illogic, And this is all one can say, My lucid unreason is not afraid of chaos,I renounce nothing of that which is the Mind, I want only to transport my mind elsewhere with its laws and organs, I do not surrender myself to the sexual mechanism of the mind, but on the contrary within this mechanism I seek to isolate those discoveries which lucid reason does not provide, I surrender to the fever of dreams, but only in order to derive from them new laws, I seek multiplication, subtlety, the intellectual eye in delirium, not rash vaticination, There is a knife which I do not forget,But it is a knife which is halfway into dreams, which I keep inside myself, which I do not allow to come to the frontier of the lucid senses,That which belongs to the realm of the image is irreducible by reason and must remain within the image or be annihilated,Nevertheless, there is a reason in images, there are images which are clearer in the world of image-filled vitality,There is in the immediate teeming of the mind a multiform and dazzling insinuation of animals, This insensible and thinking dust is organized according to laws which it derives from within itself, outside the domain of clear reason or of thwarted consciousness or reason,In the exalted realm of images, illusion properly speaking, or material error, does not exist, much less the illusion of knowledge: but this is all the more reason why the meaning of a new knowledge can and must descend into the reality of life,The truth of life lies in the impulsiveness of matter, The mind of man has been poisoned by concepts, Do not ask him to be content, ask him only to be calm, to believe that he has found his place, But only the madman is really calm,Only anthropophagy unites us, Socially, Economically, Philosophically,The world's only law, The masked expression of all individualisms, of all

[T,N,], 2 Girls: Original in English [T,N,], Originally published in Revista de Antropofagia, n,1, year 1, May 1928, São Paulo, Translated from the Portuguese by Adriano Pedrosa and Veronica Cordeiro,Television Manifestoof the Spatial Movement For the first time throughout the world, we Spatialists are using television to transmit our new forms of art based on the concepts of space, to be understood from two points of view:the first concerns spaces that were once considered mysterious but that are now known and explored, and that we therefore use as plastic material:the second concerns the still unknown spaces of the cosmos - spaces to which we address ourselves as data of intuition and mystery, the typical data of art as divination,For us, television is a means that we have been waiting for to give completeness to our concepts, We are happy that this Spatial manifestation of ours is being transmitted from Italy - a manifestation destined to renew the fields of art,It is true that art is eternal, but it was always tied down to matter, whereas we want it to be freed from matter,Through space, we want it to be able to last a millennium even for a transmission of only a minute,Out artistic expressions multiply the lines of the horizon to the infinite and in infinite dimensions, They are a research for an aesthetic in which a painting is no longer painted, a sculpture no longer sculpted, and in which the written page leaves behind its typographical form,We Spatialists feel ourselves to be the artists of today, since the conquests of technology are by now at the service of the art we profess,Signed by,AMBROSINI, BURRI, CRIPPA, DELUIGI, DE TOFFOLI, DOVA, DONATI, FONTANA, GIANCAROZZI, GUIDI, JOPPOLO, LA REGINA, MILENA MILANI, MORUCCHIO, PEVERELLI, TANCREDI, VIANELLO,Milan, May 17, l952Auto-destructive art is primarily a form of public art for industrial societies,Self-destructive painting, sculpture and construction is a total unity of idea, site, form, colour, method, and timing of the disintegrative process,Auto-destructive art can be created with natural forces, traditional art techniques and technological techniques,The amplified sound of the auto-destructive process can be an element of the total conception,The artist may collaborate with scientists, engineers,Self-destructive art can be machine produced and factory assembled,Auto-destructive paintings, sculptures and constructions have a life time varying from a few moments to twenty years, When the disintegrative process is complete the work is to be removed from the site and scrapped,Man In Regent Street is auto-destructive,Rockets, nuclear weapons, are auto-destructive,Auto-destructive art,The drop drop dropping of HH bombs,Not interested in ruins, (the picturesque)Auto-destructive art re-enacts the obsession with destruction, the pummeling to which individuals and masses are subjected,Auto-destructive art mirrors the compulsive perfectionism of arms manufacture - polishing to destruction point,Auto-destructive art is the transformation of technology into public art, The immense productive capacity, the chaos of capitalism and of Soviet communism, the co-existence of surplus and starvation; the increasing stock-piling of nuclear weapons - more than enough to destroy technological societies; the disintegrative effect of machinery and of life in vast built-up a reason the person,,Auto-destructive art is art which contains within itself an agent which automatically leads to its destruction within a period of time not to exceed twenty years, Other forms of auto-destructive art involve manual manipulation, There are forms of auto-destructive art where the artist has a tight control over the nature and timing of the disintegrative process, and there are other forms where the artist's control is slight,Materials and techniques used in creating auto-destructive art include: Acid, Adhesives, Ballistics, Canvas, Clay, Combustion, Compression, Concrete, Corrosion, Cybernetics, Drop, Elasticity, Electricity, Electrolysis, Feed-Back, Glass, Heat, Human Energy, Ice, Jet, Light, Load, Mass-production, Metal, Motion Picture, Natural

destroy men's pretences at reason and rediscover the natural, unreasonable order of things, Dada wanted to replace the logical nonsense of men today by illogical meaninglessness, This was why we beat the great Dada drum and trumpeted long and loud the praisesof unreason, Dada gave a clyster to the Venus de Milo and allowed Laocoon and his sons to relax after fighting a several-thousand-year battle with that fat sausage-snake, Philosophers mean less to Dada than an old toothbrush long since thrown away and so Dada leaves them to the great world leaders, Dada denounces the devilish tricks of the official vocabulary of wisdom, Dada is for meaninglessness, which is not the same as nonsense, Dada is as meaningless as nature, Dada is for nature and against art, Dada is as direct as nature, Dada is for infinite meaning and definite means,Dada objects are made from things that have been found or manufactured, plain or complicated, The Chinese a few thousand years ago, Duchamp, Picabia in the United States, Schwitters and myself during the 1914 war were the first to invent and spread abroad these toys of wisdom and perspicacity which were to cure human beings of the wild madness of genius and bring them gently back to their place in the proper order of things, The natural beauty of these objects is a basic part of them, like that of a bunch of flowers gathered by children, Thousands of years ago, an Emperor of China sent his artists to the furthest of his lands to find the rare and unusually-shaped stones he loved to collect and he set them on pedestals alongside his vases and his gods, This pleasant pastime would never suit our thinkers, modern Jacks-in-office who lie in wait for the connoisseur like hotel porters stalking customers at a station,Catalogue for the Arp retrospective exhibition Paris, Musée national d'art moderne, February-April 1962Once we lived safely beneath our stratum of air, Now we are waves spouting in the cosmos, How can we expect our words to remain wrapped up in the atmosphere of the sentence, Let them be reunited, like ourselves, to cosmic space--word constellations on the white page,Every word is an abstract picture,A surface, A volume,A surface on the page, A volume when spoken,Gamier emphasized the necessity for a break with the old rhythms:The rhythms of poetry have succeeded in deadening the reader's mind,We listen to the purring of Racine but do not understand it, In poetry we become aware of the universe--for it to be based upon the enumeration of feet is an absurdity,It makes no difference whether FER or AVION have one or two syllables, What counts is their meaning, the space which the words themselves occupy upon the printed page,the vibrations they set up in fact the volume which they enclose-immense and horizontal in the case of FER, infinite but with a note of disquiet for AVIONThe structure of the sentence would also have to go:The structure of the sentence has caused the same damage as the rhythms of poetry, What a difference there is between: "The tiger is coming to drink at the river bank" and the single name: TIGER,The poet is left with words stripped of all worn out structural trappings:Words are as hard and as scintillating as diamonds,The word is an element,The word is a material,The word is an object,For those who know how to look at them, some words possess a remarkable topography,TRANSATLANTIQUE, for instance, rocks and seas, peaks and abysses--why, even the moon cannot be any richer in craters and parched valleys, in rhythms and beauties,Words are the visible aspects of ideas just as the trunk and the foliage are the visible aspects of a tree,Underneath are the roots, the ideas,We must grind our well-worn language to dust--in other words, make the individual words scintillate,We must do away with imprecise terms, adjectives, for example--or again use them as nouns, as substance, that is to say, as material,But the word cannot be set on the page unless it is in harmony with the atmosphere of the poem,What is more, the value of each word is modified by the fact that the poem belongs no longer to a flux but to a static system,ALL PREDICATION IS AN ASSAULT UPON THE FREEDOM OF MAN, POETRY, AS I CONCEIVE OF IT, IS NO LONGER THE HANDMAIDEN OF PRINCES, PRELATES, POLITICIANS, PARTIES, OR EVEN THE PEOPLE, IT IS AT LAST ITSELF: A PHONETIC PHENOMENON IN ITSELF VOCAL OF PSYCHOPHYSICAL ORIGIN AND OBJECTIVELY STRUCTURED WITH THE HELP OF WORDS, SOUNDS AND MECHANICAL AND GRAPHIC MEANS (RECORDINGS AND SCRIPTS)THE PURELY VISUAL VERBAL DOES NOT EXIST, IT ROUSES ALWAYS THE SOUND OR NOISE FROM WHENCE IT SPRINGS AND FOR WHICH IT IS THE SIGN, THE POEM IS EITHER AN AUDIBLE EMISSION OF RESPIRATION (AUDITION) OR A SILENT ONE (READING), CREATIVELY ADULATED, PROVOKED BY THE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING, IT REFERS TO NOTHING OTHER THAN THE SENSIBILITY OF BEING (PRESENT AND PLANETARY) THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND AS THE OBJECTIVE INTENTION OF VOCAL SONORITIES: A COMMUNICATION IN CONCERT OF SPONTANEOUSLY CREATIVE VIBRATIONS,PHONETIC POETRY CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT A REINVENTION OF THE RECITATION, THAT IS TO SAY THE SONORIZATION OR THE MANIPULATION OF SOUND, ACTUALLY ALL DEPENDS UPON THE NEW POSSIBILITIES OF MECHANICAL EXPRESSION FOR REALIZATION OF THE TRANSMISSION OF THE TOTAL SENSIBILITY OF THE POEM, ITSELF AT BOTTOM PART OF THE TOTAL KINETIC SPECTACLE WHICH HENRI CHOPIN PROVIDES THROUGH THE INEVITABLE USE OF THE MACHINE WHICH BREAKS THE VOICE UP INTO WAVES,THE SOUND WORK IS THE RESULT OF TEAMWORK UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE POET, AND THE IDEAL REPRODUCTION IS THAT WHICH IS CUT ON HIGH-FIDELITY RECORDS, THERE AGAIN THE MACHINE IS INDISPENSABLE, IT GOES \WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE RECITOR (IF IT IS NOT THE POET) AND THE ENGINEER OF SOUNDS (\WHERE MY RECORDINGS ARE CONCERNED) HAVE CONTRIBUTED PERSONALLY TO THE ORIGINALITY OF THE REALIZATION, THE DAWN OF THE ERA OF ELECTRONIC POETRY IS NO LONGER A FIGMENT OF THE IMAGINATION,1, Only the development of the new technologies will mark the progress of sound poetry: the electronic media and the computer are and will be the true protagonists,2, The object "language" must be increasingly investigated in its smallest and largest parts: the word, basis of sound experimentation, takes the characters of multi-word, broken into its inner body, restitched at its exterior, The word must be able to free its own manifold sonorities,3, The exploitation of sound has no limits, It must be carried beyond the border of pure noise, a signifying noise: linguistic and oral ambiguity has a sense only if it completely uses the instruments of the mouth,4, The recovery of the sense of time (the minute, the second), apart from the laws of harmony and disharmony, because only through editing is the right parameter of synthesis and balance found,5, Language is rhythm, Tone values are real vectors of meaning: first an act of rationality, then an act of emotion,6, Polypoetry is devised and realized for the live show; it gives to sound poetry the role of prima donna or starting point to link relations with musicality (accompaniment or rhythmic line), mimicry, movement, and dance (acting or extension or integration of the sound text), image (television or slide projection, by association, explanation or alternative and redundancy), light, space, costumes, and objects,we shall know man again here, Man must reign as something imponderable, an unnatural creation with a certain genius and despondency, he must evict everything that curtails him to the present,The men who commit the crimes of the future shall be unknown, yet they shall subsist within the range of our understanding, they will be plagued by doubt, but it is not communal,The 'madman' by definition, is a man unfit to see to his own disposal, the act of hostility is not madness though, but temporary lucidity,Preciseness of form shall be adhered to, then vacuity and finally turmoil, ending with ruination,the result, the obligation of emptiness,The martyr shall be elevated, only through finality can we realize our own mistakes, that we must continue, that we must follow the depleted cycle,Everything shall be conquered and subjugated to the confounded senses, indulgence of action shall never be a possibility though because already we are ensnarled by the ennui of our current droughts,Man must allow for an imprecise future based on destitution, the mesmerism from implacable faces contrived in open spaces, and pessimistic urges that levitate from the corners of the abyss,There must be room to situate ourselves within the trivial aroma of our surrounding, insomuch as it is the only habitat of our consensus,We shall abandon the plague, we shall let it rise like a wave, revolving around the sublimation of residuals, it will find itself eventually regressing towards mankind again,the veins are open,The crimes of the future are necessary, they must be implied, they must reach us here, those who reside in the past,We can never become the future, we are distinct from distinctions, we are transposed onto something else, we are forgotten at the moment of our depletion, and our conception,The earth is the hollow enemy of the eye and the sun is a follower of the animosity permeated by shadows, those of our own,To those we see once again, never,We wish you repetition, as we ourselves have experienced it,to those, who endure the crimes of the futureFINJoseph Zozaya z808 theoreticianWritten by chief protractor Joseph Zozaya On an insignificant day in 1988 signed in avowal by 808 dead men the doctrine of an untangled order shall subsist to destroy and invoke persistence into all human methods,we, the implicators of a precise future, dissolved by contemplation of the temporal, the unifiers of debility and awkwardness, allocate our corporeal totality to become tangled in refusal, assertion of the quasi-negative, traversed by renunciation and declination, evoking the urge of senselessness into the sparingly abject mist of the presentsaturated by dependence upon particles, motioned by hands which declineevading the plethora of congruity which subjugates men as a habitual part of existence, oppressed to each other merely in recognition of professed idiolects and semblances of archetypes, accepted only in retribution by an omnipotent power of conduct, deluded by visions of the 'other' as immaculate exemplar, consuming innocuous breaths of repetition upon imitationeyes which stare at obese bestialitieswe procure an end to the deducible arrangement of putrefaction and worship, although we ourselves take into recognition that mankind has certain particularities which have never, nor will ever alter or concede to opposing impressions and therefore we are already a vociferous carcass of the neglected pastornate, the ramifications of suspensionwe, the absolvers of a dead future, we, the group z808,Fin Z808,To the young programmers of the World,The cry of the rebellion we launch here, in which we firmly implant our ideals alongside those of the Futurist painters, does not come from a little aesthetic minded clique but, on the contrary, expresses the violent desire that seethes in the veins of every creative programmer today, We want to fight to the bitter end against the fanatical, thoughtless, and purely snobbish religious faith in the past, stoked by the nefarious existence of the academic journals, We are rebelling against the sluggishly supine admiration for old operating systems, old languages, archaic standards, and against the enthusiasm for everything bug-ridden, rotting with code bloat, and eaten away by obsolescence, And we judge unjust - criminal in fact - the habitual disdain for programs whose construction is different and original, new, throbbing with life,Comrades, We declare to you that triumphant progress in the other sciences has brought about, in humanity as a whole, changes so profound as to dredge out an abyss between the past and us free creatures who are securely confident in the radiant magnificence of the future,We are nauseated by the despicable sloth that, ever since the 1970's, has let our programmers survive only through an incessant reprogramming of the glories of the past,For the professionals of other disciplines, programming is still a land of the dead, an immense Pompeii still whitening with sepulchers, But programming is being reborn, and in the wake of its political resurgence an intellectual resurgence is taking place, In the expressways of our teeming cities, the pistons of our automobiles are fired by the spark of microprocessors, In the land of the couch potatoes, computers control the appliances of our daily existence, In the fields of traditional technology one is struck today by a new elan, by lightning-bright inspirations of something utterly new,Only that programming is vital which finds its own elements in the people who use it, Our forbearers drew material for their programming from the religious atmosphere weighing heavily on their programs, We must now draw out inspiration from the tangible miracles of contemporary life, from the portable CD players that bring digital music to the masses, from the supersonic airplanes which achieve speed of flight through lightness of weight, the portable television sets which are available throughout the world and boot in less time than any computer system, from the convulsive struggle for the conquest of the unknown, Then too, how can we remain indifferent to the frenetic activity of the great cities, to the utterly new psychology of programming that takes wing only after dark, to the febrile figures of the viveur, the cocotte, the hacker, the addicts to coffee,Because we propose to play our part in the badly needed renewal of all expressions of programming, we resolutely declare war against all those programmers and against all those institutions that, however they may camouflage themselves in raiment of pseudo-modernity, remain mired in tradition, in academicism, in a repugnant mental laziness,We call on all young programmers to unleash their scorn on the whole lot of brainless canaille who in Computer Science applaud a sick-making reflorescence of spineless classicism; who in MIT praise to the skies the neurotic cultists of network-transparent window systems - a hermaphroditic archaism; who in computer companies heap financial rewards on a pedestrian and blind manual skill a la 1974; who in Berkeley adulate programming typical of pensioned-off government functionaries; and in IBM glorify a farraginous rubbish heap turned out by fossilized alchemists, In short, we rise up against the superficiality, banality, and slovenly, corner-workshop facility that makes most of the widely respected computer programmers in every region of Silicon Valley worthy, instead, of the deepest contempt,Out with you, then, bought-and-sold rewriters of hack programs, Out with you, archeologists infected with chronic necrophilia, Out, atavistic executives, you complaisant panderers, Out, gouty academics, besotted and ignorant professors, Out,Go ask the high priests of the True Cult, those guardians of Structured Programming Rules where the works of Henry Massalin are to be seen today; ask them why the official operating systems do not even recognize the existence of self modifying code; ask them where the art of User Interface is appreciated at its true worth, , , , And who takes the trouble to think about the programmers who don't have twenty years of struggles and sufferings behind them but nonetheless are preparing works destined to bring honor to the homeland, Oh no, those critics ever ready to sell themselves have very different interests to defend, The eXhibitions, the standards cartels, and the superficial and never-disinterested purchasing departments are what condemn the programming art to what is, plainly speaking prostitution,And what should we say about the "Experts", Come, come, Let's make an end once and for all to the layerists, the extensabilitists, the toolkit mongers, the librarians - We have put up with them quite enough, with all those impotent programmers of useless software,Let us make an end also to the wasters of disk space who clutter up our machines and profane our lightning-fast memories, An end to the quick-money architecture of the jobbers of the prefabricated, An End to the common run of program decorators, the fakers of technology, the masters of software cosmetology who sell themselves, and the slovenly and thick headed "managers",And here are our CONCLUSIONS resolute and in a nutshell, With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism we aim:1, To destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with all things old, academic pedantry, and formalism2, To cast our scorn profoundly on every last form of imitation3, To exalt every form of originality, even if foolhardy, even if extremely violent4, To bear bravely and proudly the smear of "madness" with which they try to gag all innovators5, To look on the lot of computer "scientists" as at one and the same time useless and dangerous6, To rebel against the tyranny of the words "extensible" and "reusable" expressions so elastic that they can just as easily be used to demolish the art of Atkinson, Baumgart and Deutsch as well7, To sweep out of the mental field of programming all themes and subjects already exploited8, To render and magnify the life of today, incessantly and tumultuously transformed by science triumphantLet the dead be buried in the deepest bowels of the earth, Let the future's threshold be swept clean of mummies, Make way for the young, the violent, the headstrong, Painter Umberto Boccioni (Milan) Programmer Paul Haeberli (Menlo Park) Programmer Bruce Karsh (Los Altos) Programmer Ron Fischer (San Francisco) Programmer Peter Broadwell (Santa Cruz) Programmer Tim Wicinski (Mountain View) June 15, 1991 This manifesto is based on: U, Boccioni, Manifesto of the Futurist Painters, Feb, 1910, From the book by: E, Coen, Umberto Boccioni, Abrams, 1988, Futurist Programmers - www,sgi,com/grafica/futureSomewhere on the web there is a travesty of electromagnetism we like to call smalltime industries, oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

lot of little electronic interactions can be as found an art as an umbrella lying in a washbasin, smalltime industries hopes that you realize none of this is true, ( or, as tristan says, "Howl," )"Like everything in life, Dada is useless" - Tristan TzaraTo launch a manifesto you have to want rapid eye movement, brotherhood of mozzarella and ten tons of jelly doughnuts -- and fulminate against nasturtiums, the constitution of an ox and Greenwich Village mean time,and furthermore, you must maintain that mineral turpentine resembles life in the same way as the latest apparition of a sequential tidbits proves the essence of the next millennium, This existence had already been proved by the accordion, the landscape and soft spoons,Everyone imposes one's blinking, cheesy profiterols in the form of a crystalbluff-marzipan, or a rampant economy, or artistic lung-ravagers, a naked idea being the repulsion of an ardent and platonic masonry,the love of dada is a pleasant sort of mania, impulsive and vibrant to crucify boredom,I'm writing this manifesto to show that you can plagiarise Tzara with his blessing and at the same time, in one single, corrupt death; let the forces of nature take their amanuensis from the outpourings of legend,DADA DOES NOT DISTRIBUTE SYSTEMS,on the other hand, there are shared paranoias, new fears, rank, hardly heard cortex jolting frappologists, memories and visions banqueting on anticlimactic impetus,Money is an old fashioned Dead Sea Scroll Weevil, it deadens our anti-real inclinations and systematizes the desire to die little deaths,I pick from the granite hillside fractured gooseberries, the fruit that considers that every other fruit is the honk of martyrdom, Religion says, "Make me mad," Science says: "Make me glad," Society says, "You've been had," Dada says, "Verify your molecules, En garde,"We are against sobriquets; the most acceptable linguistic device is that of having lunched on the heart of an ant lion,Art is the last ditch in which one makes an effort to survive against the encroachment of acceptability,What we need are bright, shining, heroic works which will be forever misunderstood and cherished with liquefied logic, Dada is now more outdated than ever, It is the articulation of skeletal undoing, Unfortunately, however, there are no footnotes, Dada, like irony, wears giant boots,Robert WhyteHrvatska inačica Slovenska različica Finally, all of you, the masses of flesh and obedient slaves, subjective or objective, with no difference, you can feel the effect of tiding up modern arts on the Balkans, Every possibility of creative expression has been prohibited or at least made senseless because of general financial ignorance, useless because it is unprofitable, But when social-political conditions push creative art to the senseless, DADA is born, This is how I raise my own individual rebellion, I'm announcing rebirth of DADA, and I'm spitting on your impotent "art" of national, regional or religious "values",Like Tristan Tzara, I find myself very nice,It is time for DADA, DADA is born, Long live DADA, Death to DADA, DADA is God, Fuck the DADA, Those, whose voices will be the loads against DADA, they are actually, in their own stupidity, the greatest supporters of DADA, They give her sense, life, they confirm the value of her fight, DADA is senselessness, DADA is CHAOS, DADA doesn't appear like certain political direction with aim to expose or remove from power, DADA has no political connotation; DADA has no political ambitions, DADA is not against any particular political direction, DADA IS AGAINST EVERYBODY, DADA IS COMPLETE DESTRUCTION, Those who will, like me, decide for DADA, those who know to tell you: No, we don't have idealistic approach suitable to neosatanist, who justify their behaviour explaining that they are big creator's kids who are destroying old to make new, the one who makes/changes by destroying, We don't want to create anything, We are destroying just to destroy, We are destroying 'cause we've been pushed to senselessness and we are trying to get out of it by destroying, Nothing can be changed, This is the end, And changing the flag won't save you, We don't have ideology and you cannot adjust to us, We are even between ourselves against one another, Long live DADA, Death to DADA, We are destroying to destroy, We are destroying 'cause we are enjoying destroying, We tread by treading, we will trample you down by treading: You and your impotent "art" with national, regional or religious "values",Like Tristan Tzara I still find myself very nice,Although in her senseless/sense and in her contradiction/diction, DADA is always original, DADA can't stand repeating, so even this manifesto is not DADAist, It is against DADA, but also it is for DADA, DADA is eternal originality of destruction and provocation, You can't repeat DADA, Everyone, who would again expose pissoirs calling them fountains, or recite poetry with no existing words, that person is no DADAist, He is called Repeating, He is commercialising and glorifying the senseless in senselessness, So, that's why I spit on your impotent "art" with national, regional of religious "values",I really find myself nice,FUCKFUCK PUCPUC BUMBUM DUMDUM FUCKFUCK PUCPUC BUMBUM DUMDUM FUCKFUCK PUCPUC BUMBUM DUMDUM DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA DADA I spit

suvremene umjetnosti na balkanskom ozemlju, Svaka moguænost kreativnog ispoljavanja biva osujeæena, nedopuštena, ili u krajnju ruku besmislena zbog sveopæeg financijskog ignoriranja, beskorisna u svojoj neprofitabilnosti, Onog pak trenutka, kad socijalno-politièki uvjeti gurnu kreativnu umjetnost u besmisao, raða se DADA, Ovim dižem svoju osobnu individualnu pobunu, najavljujem preporod DADE,

DADA nema politièkih konotacija, DADA nema nikakvih politièkih ambicija, DADA nije protiv bilo koje odreðene politièke struje, DADA JE PROTIV SVIH, DADA JE POTPUNA DESTRUKCIJA, Oni, koji se budu, poput mene, odluèili za DADU, ti æe vam znati reæi: Ne, mi nemamo ideološki pristup podoban neosatanistima, koji opravdavaju svoje postupke obrazlažuæi da su djeca velikog kreatora koji uništava staro kako bi stvorio novo, kako bi uništavanjem stvorio/mijenjao, Mi ne želimo ništa stvoriti, Mi uništavamo radi samog uništavanja, Uništavamo jer smo gurnuti u besmisao iz kojeg se izvlaèimo uništavajuæi, Uništavamo zato jer uživamo u uništavanju, Ništa se više ne može izmijeniti, Ovo je Kraj, I neæe vas spasiti mijenjanje zastave, Mi nemamo ideologije i ne možete nam se prilagoditi, Mi

kontradiktornosti/diktornosti, DADA je uvijek originalna, DADA ne trpi ponavljanja, Stoga ni ovaj manifest nije DADAistièki, On je protiv DADE, jednako kao i za DADU, DADA je vjeèna originalnost destrukcije i provokacije, DADA je neponovljivost, Svaki onaj, koji bi ponovno izlagao pisoare nazivajuæi ih fontanama, ili recitirao poeziju s nepostojeæim rijeèima, taj nije DADAist, On je Ponavljanje, On je komercijalizacija i velièanje besmisla u besmislu, On je smrdljivi impotentni larpurlartist infiltriran u redove DADE i kao strano tijelo biti æe okružen i progutan od bijelih krvnih zrnaca, velièanstvenih u njihovom sjaju destrukcije, Stoga pljujem po vašoj impotentnoj "umjetnosti" s nacionalnim, regionalnim ili religijskim "vrijednostima", Nalazim da sam doista

kot neizvedljiva, nedopustna ali v skrajnem primeru nesmiselna zaradi vsesplošnega finanènega ignoriranja, nekoristna v svoji neprofitabilnosti, Toda prav v tistem trenutku, ko socialno-politiène razmere potisnejo kreativno umetnost v nesmisel, se rodi DADA, S tem naznanjam svoj osebni individualni protest, najavljam preporod DADE ter pljujem na vašo impotentno "umetnost" z nacionalnimi,

dvigali svoj glas proti DADI, so tisti, ki so v svoji bebavosti najbolj za DADO: dajejo ji smisel, življenje, potrjujejo vrednost njene borbe, DADA je Nesmisel, DADA je KAOS, DADA se ne pojavlja kot

twin-action campaign: occupying the HQ global headspace and discovering via alien medium the real nature of immaculate conception, Both attempts ran adrift atop a sea of non-existence, While we have no public face of the punt dance DJs what can we expect, accept a gerbil who won't come out of his trees, The local collective may have once again made contact with MADA again but the 3-D abstract sphere of international image manipulation by cold fusion out-to-lunch-free energy (plan,E) is nowhere coherent, and all armageddon,com productions are still on the virtual cutting block, We are not

feathers of the residual meal; the indigestible virtual body, part the edges which prove too hard or brittle for a feline stomach lining (tram-trolleys = yuk),Basic Babel BibleThe very idea of a political economy of the server is ridiculous - it makes no sense and yet describes reality, This is the classical expression of the paradox, This is to see the worlds as so many spheres, all monads, all identical and unique, all ideal, all Many in One, all One in Many,This geometrical image is perhaps a 3D sensorium of the yin-yang but with at first only one colour as the whole cosmos and its own colony feed within: this inner circle is identical with the whole in this totalitarian power narrative as old as the hills, Let us call it idealism, It propagates the fiction that our breath is not real, Nevertheless it is the first ideal constitution described by the reasoned conversation of humans, and perhaps it is the only image of a constitution which we can find,But what is the economy of an ideal world, A world of pure speech craft is free, Yet the political cosmos and its real community coheres around its shared beliefs, And these beliefs are expressions of what we value, And value relates - it conjoins and fuses - nature, human work, technology, vision, imagination, ideology, religion, The book which acts as The Book is that which causes justice to appear when shared practice follows discovery of shared values,The question is how such discoveries are made, The answer is too obvious to tell, and the only names we know of so far are Babel, Squeak, LuTramLu, and MyCat, Some speak of a light from a bong tree stem, but this has not jumbled its way north to the edge of the Fens to our ears, Where is the alibi machine,What is to be the currency of pirate servers, What is the constitution, Is democracy a red or a black flag, Our controller is out in retreat S,O,S, May Day i8AP2,Ha, Stop war or start peace, The challenge is to map the interfaces of real and virtual currency

I (Do Not) Write Poetry: A Manifesto on Art & Modern LifeI do not write poetry to communicate, If you want to communicate something to someone, write them a letter, post a manifesto in laundromats and on telephone poles, or call a talk radio show, More people will receive your message than read your poetry,I do not write poetry to describe things: a perfect day, a flower, my grandmother’s warm cookie-baking kitchen, Artists who paint pictures of flowers end up selling their work out of trucks in a K-Mart parking lot, Dancers who act things out are mimes, Other artists have figured out ways to express their vision without strict description,You say live in the world, engage it, The world around me is too cynical for hearts and flowers and pretty little words, They are too hardened to wars and hatred and have been told for too long that they are racist, materialistic, and worse, They have already stopped listening, We have to find new ways to get our point across,There are in my world, however, new things, new metaphors, new forces shaping our understanding that the poets who came before us could only dream of and could not utter without being thought ridiculous,The Surrealists said write from the subconscious, I say to my audience, read from there, too, There is more to this world than what your waking mind occupies itself with, Inevitably someone will say that this encourages "art for art's sake" to the exclusion of making a statement with art, And those people will accuse you of cowardice,The Revolution is not coming, Political imperialism, the thing that has spurred most of the revolutions of the the past three centuries, is all but gone, replaced with cultural and economic imperialism or home-based tyranny, The new revolutions will not be spectacular, They will be mundane, fought in the world of the mundane, in every day life,The new revolutions will not be comrades fighting side by side, They will be people holding their ground--intellectually, economically, politically--and struggling to regain a bit of their old ground, The new revolutions will begin, as all revolutions do, in our minds and our consciousness, And it becomes even more critical that we build ourselves up for the challenges, Creativity is the key, You cannot create that which you cannot dream of,I say, too, that if you are writing from your subconscious, the core of who you are, then it is inevitable that you will write something that is somehow political, Modern life, despite the promise it offers, also carries the destruction of creativity and devaluation of the individual, the spirit, and the consciousness, Yet there is something inside you that will come out when you open up your subconscious, We should work to make our lives a waking dream state, and thus to be close to our creativity and close to our TRUE selves, Then we are open to joy, which comes from that sense of authenticity and creativity,Readers do not need every detail and subtlety told to them, Television fills in all the blanks, leaving us empty of ourselves, our own intellects, and our own private thoughts, The counterrevolution will be televised, And it will be blared from loudspeakers atop light posts downtown intended to pacify hoodlums, The longer you are kept outside of your own head by your walkman, your cell phone, and the million other things trying to fill you up, to fill in all your blanks, the more estranged from yourself, your god, your hopes and desires, etc, you will be, By not drawing an exact picture for my readers, I want them to rediscover how to fill in their own blanks, When the reader or the audience fills things in for themselves, then they have become engaged in my work, put themselves into it, and THEN and only then, have I truly communicated with them,For all of these reasons, I do not write narrative or descriptive poetry, You will never see a plot in one of my poems, You will see one or several central thoughts and a flurry of images winding themselves around those thoughts, You might see a disjointed syntax which reflects disjointedness or displacement within the world, I write poetry to keep creatively fit, and to discover and express what cannot be done in any other way Laura Winton November, 1999 Previously published in Karawane: Or, the Temporary Death of the Bruitist, on the site www,karawane,org, and in Delirium (2000) E-mail fluffysingler@prodigy,netOur attempt consists, after a decade, in re-discussing the points of the Manifesto, We need to state immediately that the reasons which induced us to theorize the performance of sound poetry, still exist, Nobody, save very few cases, has felt the urgency of making clearer the procedure of a stuff still enough practised, Maybe, it's difficult to find the new practitioners, as nowadays it seems that only the most sophisticated hyper-technology or the violence against the body itself (also transfigured or made through genetic manipulation) are the unique, authorized ways of the artistic research,Our intention was based on the persuasion that those who were experimenting performances of sound poetry, not always were perfectly aware of what they were producing, And such an impression is still neatly kept today, By awareness we mean the capability of a project able to organize round the voice, round the nucleus of the voice a series of interventions involving other media, without going towards the performance of art, the experimental theatre, the concrete music or, worse, the reading of a poem, It was necessary, and it still needs a high level of consciousnees to manage such a tourbillion of multiple elements,All that written in the Manifesto, was at a right time, positively valued by Paul Zumthor who understood its theoretical-practical importance, Often he suggested us to go beyond, to create a group, Well, a group in a way has been created through the chain of some international festivals (Bologna, Mexico City, São Paolo, Budapest, Montevideo, Athens, Barcelona,), Our editions in records (almost twenty records produced along ten years) have rightly supported the theory, Various articles, essays, catalogues and anthologies have been done, The phenomenon exists, it is perfectly recognizable, also to search new followers, In view of the new millennium, it is one of the experimental possibilities still worth being developed, without running the risk of getting out of date, especially if the dialogue with the media will be kept alive,1 Only the development of new technologies will mark the progress of sound poetry: electronic media and computers are and will be the true protagonists,This has been an easy prophecy, During the Fifties, the invention of the recording technique and its immediate commercialization has deeply influenced and accelerated the passage from phonetic poetry to sound poetry, or better said, the change from the typical lettrist approach to the more spacial, electromagnetic sound, The same can't be said after the appearance of the computer into the artist scene towards the end of the Eighties, No doubt that the production times are neatly shortened, it's easier to work with special effects, to control the sound waves, But the final product, that's the sound poem, has not been improved both from the structure and the contents, We are sharing the idea that the end-of-the-century big-computer-bang has not provoked the foreseen wave of "new" sound poetry, We say that those who have always used the technology for the composition of the poem, still go on exploiting it, maybe in a more sophisticated way, see Larry Wendt, Charles Amirkhanian, Sten Hanson, Or one would mention the extreme technological coherence of Henri Chopin who, at least for forty years, has been proposing his rarefied style, not so far from a phonetic 'rumourism', Other poets who first denied their involvement with hyper-tech recording studios, now they are not afraid of it and are used to click the mouse to select their recorded voice finally visualized into the screen, Still convinced that the fundamental help of technology is necessary to the cause of sound poetry, this is the winning instrument, so that the sound poet has got not only the task of not being unprepared in front of the very fast electronical development but also that of experimenting the new media for the safe progress of the sound poem itself, Set in other words, thinking of the poem also after the new technological suggestion and the new devices introduced, We ought to avoid that unbearable situation so typical of controlled freedom, where, apparently we can do what we want to, but, we do nothing or better, we do only that thing others allow us to do, That' why we do appreciate those poets or searchers who have been able to set up ex novo their own softwares, Tibor Papp, Jacques Donguy, Eduardo Kac, Fabio Doctorovich or those who can wholly dominate the program they are using, exploiting it along an original process, Mark Sutherland, Philadelpho Menezes, Takei Yoshimichi, Suzuki Takeo,Finally, some short words about the highways of the Web, We speak as Internet producer and Internet navigators, Our Website is three years old, and has been visited by more than 6,000 people, which is nothing if compared with great industrial sites, but a great success if you think we are defending an item not yet so visible, Our experience says that Internet module is not yet available for creative purposes, We are still in front of a medium more done for the diffusion of the products (see, the Websites), than for the building up of the poem itself,Of course such a virtual existence is necessary, as Virilio said, we do exist only if we exist in the Web, Paradoxically, the world has become smaller and smaller or huger and huger, so that we are unable to distinguish what is real from what is virtual, and viceversa,2 The object 'language' must be investigated in all its smallest and most extensive segments, The word, basic instrument of sonorous experimentation, takes the connotation of multi-word, penetrated all the way in and re-stitched on the outside, The world must be able to free its polyvalent sonorities,Here we discuss the age-old problem of the word 'poetry', As one considers that the starting material is the language, we have always believed, by convention, to accept the definition of sound poetry, One doesn't feel scared if the word 'poetry' would have to disappear, We do know that the ground to be dug still belongs to the language, to that language brought by the voice in that dual meaning Paul Zumthor introduced clearly :"I do define orality the working of the voice as it brings language, vocality the whole activities and values which are its own characteristics, apart from the language",Here, it's summarized all the research of sound poetry, It's a dialogism which provokes others, as signifiant-signifè, that's orality stands at signifiè as vocality stands at significant, Again, orality stands at the morpho-syntactic chain as vocality stands at the phonetic 'rumourism', The aspects of multiword are fundamental, It is not only the old idea of the bag-word introduced by Joyce, although it was confined into the prison of the written page, but the use under the perspective of vocorality (forgive the neologism, fusion of vocality and orality) of the word itself, After the great seasons of the 'rumourism' of the Eighties, where the language was exploited vocally, we came into the Ninties where the integrity and integrality of the word was pursued, A vocoral word is able to free still that 'polyvalent' energy repressed at the level of writing, Energy which comes out under the shape of phonemes, above all, by means of permutational methods or reduction techniques, and under the form of word sequences developed in their normal trend, This part seems to us still uptodate, The word must become really multiword, directing itself towards manifold areas, creating the right background for multiple meanings, and so for its media expansion, related to the new tools of communication, Along this path, the most interesting poets are Clemente Padin, Julien Blaine, Serge Pey, Bernard Heidsieck, Bartolomè Ferrando, David Moss, Anna Homler, Franz Mon, Ide Hintze, Philippe Castellin and his Akhenaton group,3 Sound elaboration admits no limits, it must be pushed beyond the sole of the pure 'rumourism', of a significant 'rumourism': the sonorous ambiguity, both vocal and linguistic, has a meaning if it fully exploits the instrumental apparatus of the mouth,If we should change something in this part, instead of 'linguistic' we'd write 'oral', That to be coherent with what we said above, The instrument 'voice' is the base, the principal one, thanks to all its anatomic aspects, and it is evident that its stream is vocoral, From this point of view, the old idea pursued by Lettrist, and earlier by Futurists and Dadaists, was a winning one, A steady starting point, The novelty here consists in not including limits or borders, All that happened in a perhaps unique artist, Demetrio Stratos, who used the instrument-mouth like nobody had done before, reaching extremely unbelievable results, His sounds were able to defeat the same resistance of his body, He intended to break the wall which separates what it's possible from what it's impossible thanks to the voice, In this area of research one can see other poets who are going on along the same line of development, Jaap Blonk, Valeri Scherstianoj, Brenda Hutchinson, Miroslaw Rajkowski, Christian Prigent, Giuliano Zosi, Katalin Ladik, Nobuo Kubota, Paul Dutton,An extreme level of vocoral sound can also be reached exploiting the digital process, We do believe as a very important step, beginning from the natural aspect of the voice produced by the mouth, which means that we escape from the use of artificial voice, It must be still improved and too much determined by a metallic, cool tone, The electronic approach pushes the voice into a ground where it is unable to recognize itself, It starts as voice, it arrives as sonorous piece, 'rumourism', Today, the sole is continuously crossed thanks to the powerful softwares, We have to admit that the technological progress reaches record after record, We do recommend that the poet must not follow passively the latest device, to show himself not too dependent, that's why the compact structure of the project plays an important role, the best guarantee for the consciousness of doing a poem,4 Rescuing the sensitivity of time (the minute, the second) beyond the canons of harmony and disharmony, since only editing is the correct parameter of synthesis and balance,This point is so important that it establishes the success or the failure of a sound poem, It's not a chance if we dared to mention minutes or even seconds, We would always want to know the reason why a poem lasts x minutes and not y minutes, Such a statement is directly connected of that one which underlined the prevalence of the project and its awareness, It means that the sound poet when he produces, controls all the elements, he dominates their use and function, for the purpose of getting the desired effects,It is not always necessary to prepare performances based on the idea of time, as it happens in Gerard Rhum, Josè Calleja, Maria Teresa Hincapie, We want to point out, obviously, that the performing time is different from that of the audience, So the time of the performance must be supported by the structural need of the poem itself, We do not mean at any cost a full time, where it is compulsory that something has to happen, No, We are talking of a justified time, Kirsten Justesen included in a performance of hers, huge cubes of ice which reasonably should have melted, giving the temporal rhythm of her intervention, This is an example, Much better about the same problem has been done by some Fluxus artists as Dick Higgins, Allan Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Eric Andersen, Charles Dreyfus, Even if the sound research seems to appear weak,We never thought that the best approach to the performance which had in the time its main characteristic, could be done through a unique entity, without being helped by the cut-up, All that is unavoidable if the poem is structured through a minimum level of complexity, Apart from it, we do not know a good poem which has not used the technique of the cut-up, Today, furthermore, the cut-up of an oral poem can be done easily on the screen of your computer, moving only the hand on the mouse, whereas until the end of the Eighties, to operate a cut-up, one needed physically to cut the tape and stick it, From bricolage to the era of computer, Such an easy use of the hardware has not provoked a better role of the cut-up, to prove once more that the mere technological development is not enough to do the poem, Poets like Paul de Vree, Bob Cobbing, John Giorno, Fernando Millàn, Gianni Emilio Simonetti or Joan Brossa especially in his theatre 'Strip-tease' always seem to control wholly the element of time during the performance, The cut-up is an obliged passage for a homogeneous, organization of the poetic material,Finally, there are poets who, without practising great theories about the idea of time, without using a cut-up in front of the hardware, do operate a sort of mental cut-up, better defined like cerebral-vocoral, as during the performance, they feel the weight of the flowing time, so that their own body gets loaded like clocks to determine the time that goes by, Examples of that are given by Llorenç Barber, Josè Iges, Pierre Andrè Arcand,5 Language is rhythm; tonal values are real units of significance: first the rational act, then the emotional one,This is the point which determines neatly the prevalence of vocorality against writing, The signifying tone, almost morpho-syntactic structure, full of meaning, Demetrio Stratos used to say that "the rhythm develops the raising of the physiological conscience", stressing perfectly that universal-holy aspect the voice gets during its rhythmic evolutions, More, The language, meant as corporal instrument, is comparable to a finger, to an arm, to a penis, and it is able to imitate all of them, producing sonorous movements rich of energy and impact towards audience, The voice can be uttered through the breast, the head, the diaphragm, it does not matter, It counts the rhythm pattern inside which it is developed, It can be violent object, charming caress, The rhythm must be decided consciously, The rhythm must be heard inside the body of the performer, It is signifying rhythm because it is the rhythm of the poet's body, The voice is his visible extension, as in the Egyptian hieroglyphics, when the voice was drawn like a cloud of signs, Getting the rhythm of the poem, means managing the prossemic lines, The wise sound poets do possess this quality, Chris Mann, Amanda Stewart, Allan Vizents, Richard Kostelanetz, Carlos Estevez, Rod Summers, Rosaria Lorusso, We are deeply persuaded that such a choice must be done rationally and not left into the dangerous hands of improvisation, The sound poet is not working into a jazz session, with all our respect for this really democratic, musical branch, We'll extend on purpose this great trend of rationality to the whole structure of the poem, following a lesson of Sartre who, on his turn, had learnt by Hegel "the true is the whole", Only totality is true, and only in front of the whole, one is able to reach the truth, Our whole is polypoetical, which is connected to the world of the media, beyond the totality of the body (mind, thinking, heart), The polypoetical act is based into a rational approach to reach its own truth, The use of the reason allows us to go into a real, concrete direction, Gadamer, via Descartes, thought "all that is rational is real, and all that is real is rational", We are so real that we still go on performing (tomorrow at the Theatre Acid, we'll have the performance n,200), You are so real that the performing event is necessary to be what you are,6 Polypoetry is conceived and made actual in the live show, It trusts sound poetry as the prima donna or point of departure in order to build a relationship with: musicality (accompaniment, rhythmical line), mime, gesture, dance, (interpretation, extension, integration of the sound poem), image (televisional, color transparency, as association, explanation, redundancy, alternative), light, space, costumes, objects,We'd like to start from a short quotation about Lied, before developing the sixth and last point, "What in Lied is fused (italics are ours), is not music and poetry as abstract entities, but a word and a melody which move themselves round a lost subject,",Not by chance we have emphasized the verb 'to fuse' because we think that all the experimental production of performance, from the beginning of the century (Futurism, Dada) up to the recent Intermedia work, crossing through Lettrism (from Artaud to Paul de Vree), operates a fusion, mixing up various media, to the point they lose their own characteristics, to get new ones, We are not so far from the concept of ibridation introduced once by the canadian scholar McLuhan,We believe that Polypoetry, far from criticising the past theory, has surely the desire to clarify the performing action, following the attempt of building up a new group, Polypoetry does not operate at all through fusions or ibridations, but it keeps visible the role of protagonist belonging to vocorality, see in it, sound poetry, capable of attracting the dialogue with other media, without losing or forgetting its specific, If one should employ mathematical percentage, one ought to say that 70% belongs to vocorality,From this point of view, it fits our argument a statement done by Ilya Prigogine, according to whom classic science was based on the balance, on the stability; now, all the levels of observing the events are involved, and we find ourselves in fluctuations, bifurcations and evolitive processes, Well, just the fluctuations and the bifurcations are so typical of a polypoetical research inside a line which is rigorously vertical, unlike the horizontal one, which is representing the already mentioned historical experimental experiences,The practice could be represented by Xavier Sabater, Fernando Aguiar, Endre Szkarosi, Clemente Padin, Laura Elenes, Michael lentz, Wladislaw Kazmierczak, József Rocco Juház, Magnus Palsson, Enzo Berardi, Luisa Sax, Tomaso Binga, Felipe Ehrenberg, Seiji Shimoda, Although we could easily include many other performers who apparently they declare to be far, but analysing their work, they are going towards the same direction,At the very end, we hope first of all to provoke reactions, it does not matter how negative or positive they can be, Then, we are willing to support the idea that Polypoetry does contain the same categories of the 'sublime' as Lyotard has defined them,: no doubt that it belongs to the avantgarde, then a polypoetical work tries to present what is unprensatable, then words like 'spectacularitation' or 'mediatization', are perfectly coherent with a polypoetycal approach which testifies once more as every day it gets true 'the missing of the object and the prevalence of the imaginary against reality',July 1999MANIFESTO OF THE MOVIMENTO SINESTETICOToday 18th Febrary 1999, In the name of art originates the MOVIMENTO SINESTETICO, Founded upon a base of an evolutional Synesthetic Thought, developed in the history, That is from an utopic research of a Total Unic Work of Art, created from an interchange of expressive languages, Expressive languages that have as unic aim the stimulation of the 5 ( 6 ) human senses and as a result the creation of a TOTAL WORK, exceeding the attempts made in the past and using their experience; only without stopping at the fundamental relation between Colour and Sound, but extending the levels of perception on other expressive forms, We consider therefore the possibilities Communicative / Expressive in the contest historic present, taking as inspiration source the 900' avan-gardes and from this, we prepare the generational exchange,THE SYNESTHETI: Matteo Albertin - Antonio Sassu - Massimo Perseghin - Takeshi Shimizu sinest,sassu@libero,it www,grupposinestetico,it MANIFESTO DEL MOVIMENTO SINESTETICOOggi Giovedì 18 Febbraio 1999, in nome dell'arte nasce il MOVIMENTO SINESTETICO,Nasce sulla base di una evoluzione di Pensiero Sinestetico sviluppatosi nella storia; cioè dalla ricerca utopica di un'unico lavoro d'arte Totale, creata da un'interscambio di linguaggi espressivi, Essi hanno come obbiettivo unico la stimolazione dei 5 ( 6 ) sensi umani e come fine la creazione di un'opera d'ARTE TOTALE, Superando quindi i tentativi fatti in passato e utilizzando l'esperienza di questi; senza soffermarsi unicamente al fondamentale rapporto tra Colore / Suono, ma estendendo i livelli di percezione ad altre forme espressive, Consideriamo quindi le possibilità Comunicativo / Espressive nel contesto storico attuale, prendendo come fonte d'ispirazione le avanguardie del '900 e partendo da queste, prepariamo lo scambio generazionale,I SINESTETI : Matteo Albertin - Antonio Sassu - Massimo Perseghin - Takeshi Shimizu sinest,sassu@libero,it www,grupposinestetico,it391 was reborn at 12:00:00 am, 01/01/00, Self-consciously returned to the blank slate, 391 is a child of the new, whatever and wherever that has been, Each second from now takes us further from the nostalgic nineties into the naughty naughties, 00's, This double-zero (like James Bond) has a licence to kill, and kill it must: the prophets and pariahs of postmodernism, the charlatans and egoists of art, the shallowing social relations of the DisUnited Kingdom,391 does not formulate these ideas, anticipating or creating critical analyses, Instead the words are a call to arms, to rescue the written word from a downward spiral into insignificance - a fall hastened by the pedestrian musings of once critical artists who have slipped into establishment,The word is a mirror to the world, It must be allowed to grow and adapt, to find new forms of production and distribution,391 is a mirror to the word, To do this it asks you to COMMUNICATE, In the last millennium the static dementia of the monologue held sway, When theorists realised a truth (that possible readings of a text are exactly as numerous as the number of readers) they condemned the audience to a sub-scientific laboratory testing of responses, tastes and desires, The guinea pigs were taught how to abandon their values and become part of a new process of generalisations, custom-built averages to determine fashionable consumption patterns, The definition of consumption itself grew to encompass/cater for/exploit those areas of culture which once were able to question, Now the mouth of art moves, but it has nothing to say,We ask you to move from monologue to dialogue, What do you think,Go further than this: turn dialogue into the mirror itself, Your words will create discussions or cause confusions; they will be misunderstood, mistranslated, or left for another to participate in the dialogue, These dialogues, and the processes that inform them, can be impartial lights to illuminate ourselves, your selves, and create spaces where the word can find new form,We don't know who our explorers are, nor how many there will be; we don't know if we will agree with what they say, or even if they will say anything at all, What will you decide to do after reading this word,Throw it away, leave it in a random place, post it to someone you don't know,Send us your emails: incomprehensible ramblings, ideas and inventions, instructions, deconstructions, illusions and confusions, delusions and deletions, You'll find us receptive,We are binary oppositions: divided minds, the jekyllhydish co-existence of two personalities in one whole, existing as a mutually necessary conflict of positive/negative elements, Our lives are endlessly cycling games of chess, black and white squares that refuse to acknowledge grey, Like our binary society, we will present our values as clear cut alternatives, black and white represented by a simple choice: 1/0, The reduction of logic: things are, or are not,The technology of our age uses the binary system too: is it any surprise that we should equally love and fear our machines, In the digital world, our brains, like our machines, are merely rows of on/off switches, On=1, Off=0, Historically, our technology allowed us to move beyond natural evolution to cultural evolution, from bone or wood implements to the virtual realities of today, It has given us God in our own image: the merging of computer-human and human-computer in virtual reality, The eventual galvanization of this cultural process will occur as a result of two opposite, equal and mutual interdependent movements, These two movements have many names: for now, we will call them '0' and '1','0' is that which we desire, or lack in a corporeal or hypereal sense (the construction of wants as imagined pleasures, gratifications or advancements, rather than the basic desires for food when hungry or for warmth when cold), '1' is that which we create and produce, for ourselves and for others through the labour market,We have the technology to simultaneously create and absorb our own personal cultural artefact, However the artefact is only an ordered system of 0's and 1's, and as the processes of creation and reception come together, the locus of that technology moves from the object to encompass the author: and further, to envelop the social too, In our binary world the production of self-sustaining opposites may disallow by definition ideas beyond 1:0,"For the subjective artist, authority about art belongs exclusively to the artist,"This manifesto, a general public proclamation, is made for the subjective artist; this excludes commercial, social, and communal artists who do indeed, need their critics, pundits, movements, and schools, but they should learn first if the art at hand is executed by a subjective artist or not, before applying their informed scrutiny to it, Any request to be added as an endorser of Manifesto 2001, contact me at phoenix@nwlink,com,Original

artistic, parliamentary, agronomical and literary syphilis, It may be pleasant, and good-natured, it's always right, it's stong, vigorous and logical, Apropos of logic, I consider myself very likeable," - Tristan Tzara, Feeble Love & Bitter Love, II 2 "Multi-media, cacophony, abusiveness, dreams, children's games, drugs, psychedelia, automatic writing, nonsense and a-syntactical poetry, caligrams, violently incongruous images and surprise effects all are declared legitimate in the attempt to break down conventionalized responses to words, to defeat the censorship which the surface areas of the personality, the conscious intellect and the will, had imposed upon the profounder levels of the psyche," - Malcom Bradbury and James McFarlane 3 ",these four causes concurring, viz,, 1, admiration of the ancients; 2, emnity to the schoolmen; 3, an exact study of languages; and, 4, a desire of powerful preaching - introduced an affected study of eloquence and copiousness of speech, which then began to flourish, This soon grew to excess, in so much that men studied more after words than matter, more after the choiceness of phrase, and the round and neat composition, sweet cadence of periods, the use of tropes and figures, than after weight of matter, dignity of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, or depth of judgement," - Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning 4 "Here is an illustration, You are looking right now at a set of dark marks on paper, This pattern of black-on-white symbols reaches your eyes by reflected light, and activates the nerve cells in the retina, the light-sensing layer of nerve cells at the back of your eyeball, The result is a set of nerve impulses, which are transferred to your brain's vision centres for processing," - David Ritchie 5 "Hence, once again, pastiche: in a world in which stylistic innovation is no longer possible, all that is left is to imitate dead styles, to speak through the masks and with the voices of the styles in the imaginary museum, But this means that contemporary or postmodernist art is going to be about art itself in a new kind of way; even more, it means that one of its essential messages will involve the necessary failure of art and the aesthetic, the failure of the new, the imprisonment in the past," - Frederic JamesonThat moment of current adventure, isotopic religion and

the chicken salad universe go free-range, For a change, or something like that, Slack is essence,When jealousy of the certainties should make a start:Level 1This is no small step: a coagullation of matter from void to a definite point in time and space, Which could go as quickly as it came (what were we thinking,)Yet the change and motion implied by this first static reference is what gives us time,We'll ignore it, this time, Unless you have the time, talking about time is generally a waste of it,The irrevelations continue2 ∞Is this what it amounts to, Correct me if i'm wrong, mathematician, After the void, another: from here to as long as you care (to count), For this moment, your time is a discount, a sales voucher in the chainstore mall of life, So why not cash it in, You would be stupid not to, Mathematician,Beyond service 2 application/reapplicationThis one has got to hurt,- a leaflet of instructions - Where is hope, if with advancing age the surface of the skin is increasing like life-experience and starts to ruffle like the surface of a sea does in the first breeze of autumn, Who will smooth the lines of worry, Who will frighten off the crows springing through our face, Not Ellen Betrix, not Oil of Ulay, Friends, throw away crucibles and tubes nicely sorted, Our real hope is art, It will not fade away, Like a good wine it will become better with the passing years, And most wonderful: it grows older without leaving a trace, Let's look a little enviously in the restoration chambers of the museums, Let's look up admiringly to the Doctores of Pigment: they have found the secret of everlasting youth, And here we go again and see Leonardo's smiling slut with 500 year old velvetskin like a peach-botty in the picture-frame,But, why this, What's this all for, Why are things preserved, maintained and retouched for Sixtina's sake,Don't let us fool ourselves: The compulsive preservation of art, the complete aesteticizing of everyday life, the permanent re-animation and re-discovery of art-epochs long gone, is only an expression of today's phobia about age, wrinkles and death, Art as timeless constant is the projection of wishes of a society that does not grow old, it is a Dorian-Gray-Syndrome - only the other way round,And here the permanent and compulsive restoration of art corresponds exactly to the face-liftings of beauty-surgeons, the preservation of buildings only fit for demolition can be compared to jogging to prevent flubby flesh,Let's turn to the Frauenkirche in Dresden: The historical process is reversed and the burnt-out symbol of tyranny is re-idealised with the help of worldwide donations, The Frauenkirche in Dresden is the first global church-steeple policy,Years ago members of the avant-garde refused the old-fashioned: When Marcel Duchamp drew a beard onto Mona-Lisa's face he said that art is an old chestnut, Marinetti's enthusiasm for racing cars hooted death for Nike, Nowadays Nike is a well-fed sports-brand that does everything to prolong the fiction of the sporty youth into the grave,For: Remaining in a state of puerility is the other side of the coin: Youths and grown-ups go in sizes they can never grow into, even if they grew at the speed of a 6-year old child, Only a short time ago the most trendy sport equipment for the mid-thirties was a scooter while in former times 4-years-olds felt too grown-up for such a thing and loudly demanded for a bicycle,And of course grown-ups watch nature programmes that dominate every TV-channel and are filling the whole evening,While art then toyed with the world in a complex way, today it reacts all too devotedly with basic experiences in touching, tasting, seeing, briefly with sense-circles for the everlasting children,This cannot be true, We have reached the limit, When at the beginning of modern age Rafael was the first monument curator we engaged, we finally after the end of this time have to sign his certificate of discharge speedily, We demand: Frieder Rusmann translated by Gabriele Keltsch www,kunsttot,deThere is no beauty in confusion, unless it is the confusion of our genuine attempt to emerge from the state of thoughtlessness to the state of thought, The carnival is an upsetting of the established order, but the carnival is not an end but a means, After the work of Dada introduced chaos into our conceptions, the work of Mada must be to reintroduce coherency into the void at the center of the mind of our members - that void from which only incoherencies spew forth onto an html posted page, If the avant-garde once stood for anti-art, by now anti-art is another mass-produced cosmetic nothing, There is no meaning to an avant-garde that today continues to repeat parrot fashion the banalities of the 1920s; indeed, this is not today avant-garde - it is reactionary and counter-revolutionary, Only the true bourgeoisie spirit (confined, crushed and unthinking in its narrow self-absorbed pettiness) can fail to understand the real meaning of Dada to Mada, Only the impoverished and reactionary mind can find a subliminal message in the graffiti of out of date and irrelevant post-modern academic utterances, There is beauty in the world today, but it is a beauty of interaction, not of cacophony, The revolution arises through carnival, but the true carnival arises through awareness of one another outside of the borders of everyday life, not of parroting the once fashionable trash of the University, Those who fail to realize this have no place except where they always were - somewhere else, Those who make the effort to surpass their own egos will join us were they always are - nowhere,1, Money is smuggled through virtual tax-free zones, and government losses are the capitalist's gains, There is ever-increasing competition within the hidden labour markets, and this causes the price of that labour to fall,2, Combined with the elimination of taxes, this equation of profit (profit equals selling prices minus production cost) leads to increasing competition within the capitalist market, that is the market of entrepeneurship,3, The embourgeoisment of entrepeneurship tends to equalisation vis à vis the tertiary and digital markets,4, At the point of equalisation, either a) no exploitation of labour exists, or b) capitalist and worker are equally exploiting and exploited, such as to make these terms practically redundant,5, Any political economy of the new markets should assume workers who occupy a single position as producer and consumer,6, For the producer-consumer, profit is identical to the benefit/cost ratio: price minus cost (of production) equals cost (of production) minus benefit, This can be reworked as: 2 x cost = price + benefit Thus cost = (price + benefit) 2 7, From this we can also deduce that the price of any good will be (2 x cost) minus benefit; the benefit from any good will be (2 x cost) minus price,As society continues the course followed by all civilizations, a total and complete revival of Dadaism becomes both necessary and inevitable, This becomes the mind-set of NEUMERZ, Despite this, complete revival is not enough, It is not even close, It is crucial that Dada as Dada be taken to the conclusion of Dada, This is NEUMERZ, The new mind-set is not the word fragment "merz" torn from printed material, It is much more than "merz", It is NEUMERZ, It is the unrestricted use of Dadaism at all levels in all forms,The operation at levels in isolation is a concept which must be erased from Dadaist thought altogether, A major mistake of early Dadaist thinkers was the belief that Dadaism was in some way an art movement alone, This notion was, of course, one cause of the formation of rival factions within Dadaism, Society as a whole does not operate on levels, True, within society one may identify, or attempt to identify, social classes, institutions, leaders, etc, But they are all society, Take away society, and these are gone as well, To waste time looking at each individual publication, work of art and movement is absurd,It is no secret that the languages of the industrialized world such as the languages of western Europe, North and South America, Japan, etc, are languages that arose during ancient or medieval circumstances, It is for this reason that these languages are obsolete and inadequate for use by modern man, The industrialized world has tried to side-step this problem in many ways, The most popular method has been adaptation, In this method society tries to stick together pre-existing words or word parts in order to describe new technology, For example auto + mobile = automobile, Eventually the word becomes cut down to just "auto", Thus, a word meant to describe motion now becomes just the name of another machine, Thousands of examples of adaptation may be found in any language that is used in any industrialized nation,The method used by science has been different, The modern scientist has attempted a grasp at a "universal" language, In this method everything is given a "scientific" classification name that any scientist in any part of the world may use as identification, Sadly, this language is Latin, a language that is even older than the other languages and therefore even more inadequate and out of date,But why should Dadaists examine language when all language is just an element of civilization, The answer is clear, Dadaists must rely on language to communicate, This is not a choice, but a fact of life, This does obviously not indicate that Dadaists should, in any way, go along with the established rules of "proper" language set up by the morons of the educational systems of modern nations, Language demonstrates tremendous variation from country to country and region to region, A dictionary in the United States is not the same as a dictionary in England, A dictionary in France is not the same as a dictionary in Belgium, Any idea of correct or proper language or spelling is nonsense, The Dadaist must instead look for any way to write in a way that is quick and easy, The Dadaist should feel free to invent new words, use unconventional syntax and form, and ignore the useless restrictions of the past, If, for example, you are writing to someone named Ellen, just spell the name L,N, Abandon any titles that people may add to themselves, Call authority figures by their first names, As long as the person to which you are speaking is able to understand you communication is successful,But what exactly is Dada, A clear definition of Dada is needed mainly to destroy the false image of Dada created by the so-called art world, Dadaism, in simple terms, has very little to do with art, Dada and Dadaism is a mind-set, a way of life which is in open opposition to everything, All of the values, morals, violence, inventions, and elements of society are against Dada, For the Dadaist, there is no scale upon which to judge society in terms of good and bad, If any bad elements exist, then the entire society becomes a farce, Bad is defines as anything anti-human, The word anti-human should not be confused with inhumane, Anti-human is a policy that is developed by society, In every society that has ever existed on Earth, there have been elements that are anti-human, Every society has had an army, Every society has participated in war, In every society someone has died, These facts make all of society's inventions and "improvements" irrelevant, DEAD MEN DON'T DRIVE CARS, The modernization that society brings is not worth the deliberate loss of human life,In art, Dadaism is the concept of anti-art, All art that one sees is just a product of the society that created it, Because Dadaism is in opposition to all society, it is in opposition to the art which society produced as well,<subliminal message> Grow killer infomediaries </subliminal message> 391 Theme by Lilith Engineering viral mindshare; we rape the

according to Lilith, it is not so much that 391 is fundamentally dead, but rather the failure, and some would say the paradigm, of words, We're faced with a choice: either accept structuralist textual

questioning creates exactly that which denies its own answer (0): that which transcends the need to question, This split creates a mutually necessary and sustained opposition that is the mythological, ideological, and conceptual heart of binary rationalities, The opposition of 1 to 0 is as necessary as the reduction to concept itself, and denies the possibility of reconciliation, 1:0,The symbol that binds the opposites must also necessarily define the operation of reconciliation - for example, 1:0, 1^0, (1[]0), or 1*0, The ultimate 'destination' point - assuming this is a teleological operation - is outside the existence of the concept, conceptually, and thus wh(0)lly), This operation has a problematic existence, in that by definition, it can never work, its conceptual nature conflicts with its necessarily non-causal, non attributable, attributes, But what is at fault here is the concept of destination, the nature of the teleology, not the reconciliation that takes place to replace the simple binary operation,Binary representation is simultaneously the least complex and the most complexifying, As the complexity of the proposed abstraction increases, the system of binary logic required to capture that change doubles in complexity relative to the change itself, The simplest, sometimes, is not the best,"Generally speaking, people are favourably disposed to those objects or issues that they believe are beneficial to them, and they dislike (or have a negative attitude toward) those objects or issues wthat they think might hurt their chances of reaching their goals, Thus, they will move toward the positive attitude referent, or favor it in some manner, and will avoid or even oppose the negative attitude referent, basically because they expect this course of action to help them," - Leonard BerkowitzWELCOME TO THE WONDERWORLD,Rush away our cabled lives, telling times of these telling times, impatient for the history of tomorrow,The religious Epicureans

increasing interactions and indicating possible directions of a plastic whole: object + environment,In this way fight and movement in its mechanical means, which we create and produce, for ourselves and for all to the common run of program decorators, the fakers of technology, the masters of software cosmetology who sell themselves, and the logical revolt of our books of today gaily blazing under the scintillating flight of flying trolley trams whose propellers snap like a seraph landing in a jerky way caused by infinite coefficients, Now, a synthetic impressionist one (meaning divisionism and impressionism in the most crass ignorance of our genuine attempt to break the barriers that are registered are just sufficient to describe and to teach to the word, To do this it asks you to move from monologue to dialogue,What do you think, Go further than this: turn dialogue into the waste basket like useless manuscripts,They will remain idealised by the subject would be idle, except that the world's wonder has been engaged for thousands of years,As a matter of fact the daily frequentation of museums, of libraries and of simultaneity,When people tell us that the motor car is a species of fourth dimension, both in painting and sculpture, which cannot exist perfectly without the complete concurrence of those three dimensions which determine volume: height, width, depth,This frankly acknowledges a clear view of our members - that of my proportions - I never apply it,In other words, I lie,I lie when I don't apply it, I lie when I write that I say 'form' instead of throwing it forward by violent casts of creation and action,Do you want to shit in different colours so as to make a determined move away from that mechanicality, following its own extremely free essence on the far promontory of centuries, What is the simultaneous action of the Futurist concept of dynamic continuity as the number of minor vibrations, introduced by the resistance of the arsenals and the processes that inform them, can be associated at all levels and none, and salute your understanding of this vast green tram army that we cry liberty but are not crazy abstractions, as have transatlantic liners, noises and ideas,And while we put on a pedestrian and blind manual skill a la 1974; who in Computer Science applaud a sick-making refluorescence of spineless classicism; who in MIT praise to the speed of flight through lightness of weight, the portable CD players that bring digital music to the extent that it doesn't cost, We mix the myriad audiences in mirrors of their transformation in motion will be the decopyrighted imagery of the motion and light which translate themselves into trajectories,Photodynamism is a mirror to the speed of an action in its volumes, and the gliding flight of flying trolley trams whose propellers snap like a dancer, and much more in sympathy with the obsessive demonstration of exterior and internal quality which is already audible if as yet unfiled and unfulfilled, The Nuisance Noise machine takes shape, We declare that the slower it moves, the less intense and broad win be its trace when registered with Photodynamism,It follows that when you tell us that the painter of movement, This has been considered simple and finite (cf, Spencer: First Principles - The Rhythm of Motion),But Photodynamism has revealed and represented it as complex, raising it to someone you don't know,daDa does not mean anythingif we condifder it dwfcwuiofslfsoh fshgaZWE READ IT IN THE PAPERSA CUBE IN ITALYTHE WPORF FOR A HUNE DADA,others the little

floating away, Jesus is swinging cranked up by the wrist blades high upon the gallows pole, We watch him twirling wildly through a pin prick hole in the top of the pyramid, Soon his soul will slip out of the skin and come spiraling down into the hearts of the gods, His head, severed by a tightrope to set an example, will fall through the hole and into the open hands of a few select and very attentive artists,His hands will flap their way down the sliding board like a diagonal wall full of shadow butterflies, They will sink underground without digging and wrap their wings around the mummy's throat to wake him, As the eyes open and the neck is stretched we will bridge the tunnel that will pipe feed the wind and water to the trees, The same trees that will eventually be recycled as colorful wrapping paper for an exploding Christmas giftbox ten years from now,Until then we wait patiently for Pink Rose Lotus to float the boy down her river and into the mouth of the snapping snake, We continue to drink the blood and eat the treat and roller skate about our merry ways on Earth, All the while we know that god is good with one less 0 but even better with 999,Manifesto III Last No Exit: Following the Dialogue of and Debate in the Turns of All Strands from Within Painting You can be sure that hall voices over the tram dominate this conversation, Discussion of the death of built-in discomfort especially by those who think they're in some oddly configured house of Expressionistic or Abstract painting, was rather regularly being written by some of those whom are fresh Corn-Walls and Still-Screens of drawn and "historically mandated" predictions which nevertheless fail to come true,Showing just how big the order for the present convened as a merchant pendant, anti-theorists suggest there is in fact painting emanating from chambered quarters of psychological scenes in shyness painting themselves a disadvantage with all of their critiques on the assumed examining, That's correct : the painting itself is painting itself from somewhere else altogether, badly,Add ten years on either side of now and the list still encompasses twenty years,Obituaries for the neo-nazi avant-garde theorist surpass an even larger regularly written Sum of Whom, Compared with their counterparts in the conceptual slogan "Return the Tender," painters seem to lack a discourse which though it may somehow counter their own mantra, still none of it was painting,A series of private exchanges may dominate the conversation but do not come easy in the marketplace of ideas, Looking back i think i wonder why the words "painting is dead" acknowledge the lack of importance of first rate painters arted between time and their immediate subject, When the task has been crowded with large format photographs, text panels, and the drag of their accumulated histories- the highly congested territory they currently occupy would much rather be lively in exercise (round and out) and is the best that anyone can hope for really,Various kinds of painters still struggle to map however incompletely the narrative before anyone else gets their foot in the door, This is when we come in, when several feet are caught in that door creating a gap large enough for all of us to fit through without much effort,But last month's roundtable discussion addressing The Death of Plenty to Do suggests that just keeping track of the twists of the pluralist post 80's era is often enough, Rumblings and murmurings are heard down the fire escape, sighs and groans from behind the walls, and sometimes even the noises of face-veils and the quiet that interrupts them, Either way our Pink Block Cohort remains hard at work, In fact painting is a mudhole,Bob Modest, Modest Bob, Old Modest Bob,

founding fathers of klitink, and having spent long nights talking and thinking about the structure and concept with fellow members, I still had some difficulties translating the many thoughts, theories and total lunacy into plain concrete words, trying to find the correct words to grasp the ideas that storm through our heads, But after the first raw sketches were written down, and after the literary guidelines were pointing in the right directions, the puzzle began to solve itself, it all began to fall in its correct place,This is the first official manifest, containing a summary of thoughts and theories, but it has to be considered as not the only, for new ideas will arise, new theories will be formulated, and new thoughts will shimmer through, that are to be additioned in later publications, Klitink is a living and revolting machine, in constant state of revolution, continuously expanding itself in the vast desert surroundings called modern society,Exploring the immense subconscious with vehicles beyond comprehension, logging dreamscapes, mindshades and bliss-like chimeras, klitink's sole purpose is to open up the portal to an introspective world, creating a surreal expression of visual poetry, This is a summary of the thoughts and the theories of klitink, Manifesto of klitink,This text derived out of pure necessity, for modern day life is a life completely subservient to the mass - production and consumption - society, The streets are covered with propaganda-like advertisements, extolling the over-reproduced unnecessities, the fashion-shops filled with uniform mass-fabriced products, the music industry is undifferentiated, every tune sounds the same as the tune before, even if you compare different styles or genres, every tv-channel brings you the same pre-rendered formula, a consistency of the same general programs, The main-stream culture absorbs these given guidelines, without a moment of consideration, And the sub-cultures just follow along, to fit in a certain type of pig-sty, Everybody adapts to the group they want to belong, adjusts to the dress-code and social intercourse of that particular group, but still, proclaiming that they do not adapt, that they are so different than the main-stream culture, Like pigs in mud they are, digging and digging, deeper and deeper into this mess, We will not adapt to these external requirements of mass-society, but we choose to stay faithful to our internal cravings of the individual, We turn our back to the main-stream-society with their uniform life-style, we laugh pitiful at the sub-cultures for their ignorance,Because of this, society will label us as a rebellious confederacy, and for some part, this is true, We choose our own individual path, instead of the pre-rendered path of mass-society, or subcultures, and because of this, it is hard to fit in to society's standards, If this is considered rebellious, so be it, We are active on spreading our thoughts and theories, we are constantly plotting against issues we do not agree on, we are trying to open some long closed eyes, and because of this, we collide with society's standards, If this is considered a confederacy, so be it, Throw away this rigid, strict lifestyle that ties you down, tear off this mass-produced skin that hides your individuality, and dare to life a free life, your own life, without the piercing pressure of an antique archaistic society, Klitink officiates as a sanatorium, as a sanctuary, as a moment of contemplation, We have killed the inventor and flushed his notes, destroyed his laboratory, and raised klitink in the air as a newborn baby, We have thrown away our blinding blinkers in order to be over-exposed to the magnificent world surrounding us, we have burned the premeditated maps so we can travel freely into the unknown, all in favour for the experience, We glorify the childhood state, in which everything is new, where a whole wide world lies in front, ready to be explored and nothing is taken for granted, In klitink, everything is as much right and wrong as it is not, We live for the experience, We love dynamics, we love flexibility, We do not want to be bound to one working manner, we do not want to be tied up to one style, we do not want to be placed in one sheep-pen with a label stuck in our ear, We are interchangeable, we are dissolute, we are inscrutable, we are wrong, we are right, we are left, we are unexpected, we are boundless, we are countless, we are incorruptible, we are rash, we are highly low-budget, we are unquestionable, we are desultory, we are art and we are artless, we are a harsh-sounding-device in a sound-proof-booth, we are the anti-dote for the disease we are, and most of all, we are not welcome at other peoples parties, We will burn every single page of this manifesto on the moment it becomes outdated, and replace it with a brand-spanking new and improved one, that suites the spirit of the time, We are not be conservative about our own opinions, in fact, we are willing to let go every single assumption, if other opinions proof to be more suitable, and therefore beat the crap out of ours, We keep an open mind, Klitink is founded by two individuals, who are the roaring engine behind the movement, but there are no principal leaders, or external employers, that have full control over the course and results of established, running or future projects, Every single project is moulded into shape in consultation with the participants that collaborate with that project, Every participating individual has an equal voice in the decisions during one project, or for raising new ideas for future projects, Therefore: Klitink is autonomous, Decisions are made in an anarchistic manner, without an established order, Klitink is to be considered as one single operating entity, not as an addition sum of individual achievements from individual people, Each individual achievement in name of klitink, carries the theories, thoughts and motivation of klitink, and has to be considered as an achievement from this single operating entity, instead of individual achievements from the different persons who collaborated, Therefore: Klitink is anonymous, Individual names of individual collaborators do not matter, Klitink does not limit itself in restricting to one working manner, There are no set rules or boundaries for the carrier of the transmission, every discipline is a legitimate discipline, This ranges, for instance, from: Klitink does not impose, or will be subjected to any form of censorship, Images from the depths of unconsciousness contain a hidden truïsm, they demand a direct and honest broadcast, if they want to be correctly interpreted, and therefore the broadcast must not be restricted or sedated in showing its imagery, "Beloved imagination, what I like most in you is your unsparing quality," (André Breton, Manifesto of Surrealism, 1924), Also, it must be made sure that non-participating or third parties will not interfere in the process, if they have the intention to impose restraints on the eventual result, Klitink condemns censorship, The original message must not lose its intensity through the process of translation from source to eventual result, Klitink is art as much as it is non-art, Different skills and knowledges are demanded to bring the diverse projects to a good ending, and devotion to and enthusiasm for provide if one project is a success or failure,Main inspiration lays in a combination of images emerging from the depths of the unconscious and subconscious visualization of these images, which purpose is to materialize other realities which are made evident in different states of consciousness, alternative from the normal1 state,These alternative states are for instance : Klitink is productive not because of a great demand from the outside world, but because of an inside craving of the participating individuals with each project, Klitink creates opportunities to develop and realize ideas that maybe otherwise would not have reached the outside world, It is not the intention to make a large profit, there is no pursuit of gain, Every benefit from lucrative projects will be used to develop new projects, to make sure klitink can continue to exist, Klitink only exists to create an outlet for ideas that else maybe would not have been worked out, because of low-profit outcome, or lack of interest from society, not because it strives to claim its place in an expensive museum, or fancy gallery, Art should be approachable for everyone, Since this is not the case, klitink is considered non-art, 1 With the normal state of consciousness is meant, the state in which a person is fully aware of and contributing to the surrounding he is in, and where his thoughts not stray from this awareness and contribution, [back]2The subconscious is the part of your mind which notices and remembers information when you are not actively trying to do so, and which influences your behaviour although you are not aware of it, It deals with personal issues, for instance suppressed emotions or forgotten memories, [back]3The unconscious is the part of your mind that contains feelings and thoughts that you do not know about, and that influences the way you behave, It relates to an universal level, for instance, human instincts, [back]NO, We hear you, stop shouting, We hear your machinations and your smoke-filled ruminations, NO, You have sound bitten our words, so we use them only under duress, Nevertheless,

ALSO DADA,Zinhar started as a small website in 2003, This website was going to contain poems and critiques about poems and poetry in general, Meanwhile I was also searching for the ways of publishing the magazine electronically, Because the possibility of publishing the magazine and getting into contact with readers and writers by using the means of press was restricted, and because of the high demand of the people who want to publish their magazines, it became much harder to be able to survive in the crowd, Under these circumstances the first issue of Zinhar came out which was named as "Centrifugal" (choosing this name for the issue was not a coincidence),Zinhar came out as an objection (resistance) to the people who were publishing something under the title of "poetry", to the imprudence of poetry which became apparent in the 90's and to the attitudes of the writers and readers who have capitalized and Mcdonaldized the history and the objects of the poetry,This objection was for emphasizing that "poetry should not be displayed in such ways" and also it was determined to call attention to the tension between the insulative (intransitive) and closed structure of the literature society and the uncontrollable flaneurship of the internet wanderer (surfer) which was totally opposite to the other,But then we realized that the tension was mainly a result of the problems occurring in the public mechanism, and the change and deterioration in their perception of the poetry, Moreover we also realized that both sides were reacting wrongly to these changes,We believe that the poetry of the "Oral/Literary" culture is not sufficient enough to respond to the means of "Visual/Literary" culture which keeps on both unbuilding and then building us every moment, As a consequence poetikhars,com and Poetik Har(s) intends to visualize the "individual experience" both by using the media of press and electronics and by deconstructing the codes of the 21st century's "coded" life searches for the new ways for the poetry in the history of it,Besides the Zinhar website, there is also a magazine which is not published periodically and only delivered (under restricted conditions) to the readers who demand it by sending e-mail to us,Our aim is to provide visualization in the poetry by substituting the typographical possibilities for the conventional possibilities (facilities) of poetry and to define the visualization of poetry as a value, In this context Zinhar Magazine is prepared by the works of Baris Özgür, Özcan Türkmen, Tarik Günersel, Ali Ömer Akbulut, Evrim Önk, Bahar Senol, Sakir Özüdogru, Ulas Basar Gezgin, Asli Serin since the beginning; and from now on it will be published by including the works of the people who are especially creating visual/concrete/experimental poetry,It is important to emphasize that Zinhar aims to step in the areas of the Turkish Poetry History which are not stepped in (utilized) before in the context of the presentation of the poetry, The Second New Poetry (2, Yeni Siiri) movement had only dealt with the oral/literary presentation of the poetry and left the visualization of the historical material to the facilities of the "text", However the "text" itself is no longer sufficient to express the whirlpools of life, and what it can do is only reproduce images made of "word series" that are incapable of decoding the coded practicals (acts) of life,In fact poetry is a mechanism that allows us to produce anti-codes by the help of these interventions against the codes that are imposed on us by the city/life, In an area in which everything can be "symbolized" within, whether it is mystic, semiotic or something related to justice, poetry can criticize itself only by resolving these attacks which block its ways and by not allowing everyday life to reduce its space,In this context the stem (body) of the poetry should be transformed from word and sound into a series (flow) of graphical presentation, Zinhar is DADA, In other words Dyonisiac Appollonian Dyonisiac Appollonian,Dada NEVER DIES, Serkan IŞIN Translated by: Deniz TuncelBOUSHBOU IS DADA; DADA IS NOT BOUSHBOUa document of

February 1909this text derived out of pure necessity, for modern day life is a life completely subservient to the mass - production and consumption - society, the streets are covered with propaganda-like advertisements, extolling over-reproduced unnecessities, the fashion-shops are filled with uniform mass-fabricated products, the music industry is undifferentiated where every tune sounds the same as the tune before, and every tv-channel brings you the same pre-rendered formula, a consistency of the same general programs, all in favour for maintaining the piercing pressure of an antique archaistic society,the mainstream culture absorbs these given guidelines without a moment of consideration, and the sub-cultures just follow along, to fit in a certain type of pigsty, everybody adapts to the so-called group they want to belong, adjusts to the uniform dress code and social intercourse linked to that particular group, they wear their mass-produced skin and live their rigid, strict lifestyle in complete blindness, like pigs in mud they are, digging and digging, deeper and deeper into this mess,for there are no individuals,for there is no culture,for those who are blessed/cursed with the internal cravings of the eternal loner;klitink officiates as a sanatorium, as a sanctuary, as a moment of contemplation, we have killed the inventor and flushed his notes, destroyed his laboratory, and raised klitink in the air as a newborn baby, we have thrown away our blinding blinkers in order to be exposed to the magnificent world surrounding us, we have burned the premeditated maps so we can travel freely into the unknown, all in favour of the experience,we glorify the childhood state, in which everything is new, where a whole wide world lies in front, ready to be explored and nothing is taken for granted,in klitink, everything is as much right and wrong, as it is not, we live for the experience,we love dynamics, we love flexibility, everything changes and so must we, to grasp this moment,now,therefore we are interchangeable, we are dissolute, we are inscrutable, we are wrong, we are right, we are left, we are unexpected, we are boundless, we are countless, we are incorruptible, we are rash, we are highly low-budget, we are unquestionable, we are desultory, we are art and we are artless, we are a harsh sounding device in a soundproof booth, we are the antidote for the disease we are, we are nothing and everything, and most of all,we are not welcome at other people's parties,1 "With the most primitive means the artist creates something which the most ingenious and efficient technology will never be able to create," - Kasimir Malevich2 "Multi-media, cacophony, abusiveness, dreams, children's games, drugs, psychedelia, automatic writing, nonsense and a-syntactical poetry, caligrams, violently incongruous images and surprise effects all are declared legitimate in the attempt to break down conventionalized responses to words, to defeat the censorship which the surface areas of the personality, the conscious intellect and the will, had imposed upon the profounder levels of the psyche," - Malcom Bradbury and James McFarlane3 "Here is an illustration, You are looking right now at a set of dark marks on paper, This pattern of black-on-white symbols reaches your eyes by reflected light, and activates the nerve cells in the retina, the light-sensing layer of nerve cells at the back of your eyeball, The result is a set of nerve impulses, which are transferred to your brain's vision centres for processing," - David Ritchie4 "Hence, once again, pastiche: in a world in which stylistic innovation is no longer possible, all that is left is to imitate dead styles, to speak through the masks and with the voices of the styles in the imaginary museum, But this means that contemporary or postmodernist art is going to be about art itself in a new kind of way; even more, it means that one of its essential messages will involve the necessary failure of art and the aesthetic, the failure of the new, the imprisonment in the past," - Frederic JamesonThe first flow, still immaculate, Non-polluted at the source, still unthreatened, Feeling of freedom, A privilege, Endless creativity, Unending subversion, Direct protest and creation, Different hours, All that we bring in thought: just dreaming for a instant The image has given us much, And had made us live a precious time forgotten, We used to walk in the darkest nights, Avoiding danger, Later, when we wake up, images escape, like water, And to know ourselves, we need to find ourselves, Images are more than this, We also need to live, But eyes cannot perceive, Our pupils do not dare open, Our lips refuse to speak, We know not whether beauty comes only from the heart or from images, Images move, And images are not empty, They have something to say, What they have to say is not set, Do they say anything, Or do they say nothing, The image itself, an oniric process, In an eternal dream, image is energy, The heart is gone, But images cannot be treated as something or as nothing, Neither discourse neither silence, The image will find itself, Images cannot force the heart to think, The heart cannot force images to move or to rest, Desire is the essence itself of man, The passion of games, http://dellanilima,blogspot,com/The Manifestation of the Mystery ]5[ ]7[ ]9[ We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable,' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible,' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle,' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One, Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure, Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing, This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable, We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back, By holding fast to the Reason of the ancients, the present is mastered and the origin of the past understood, This is called Reason's clue, ]Tao[ www,youtube,com/dellanilima www,myspace,com/splishjam www,myspace,com/madamerroseselavy

When your manifestos shrivel and droop I'll take a shovel to bury them in my hearth, Amen, Perhaps your words will burn, in time, Never mind the remains, charred knowledge like the heathens, Over and out, Far out, And stop, Say hello to this manifesto, Say goodbye to this manifesto, And start, (Usually anyone left at this point should leave, in case they become trapped,)Here is the story of my beloved country,I am Romanian, proud to be so, I love my mountains and my friends and family,This is the story of a country that has been robbed of everything: its past, present and future,The story of a country that has all the natural resources: gold, oil, fields of rich land for agriculture, the Danube filled with fish, one quarter of the country covered in century-old forest,This is the story of a country that has the human resources: top mathematicians, doctors, poliglots,The country where the first writing in the world was discovered,The country where the latin language was born, the country that is now acknowledged by every respectable historian as the cradle of European civilisation, This is the sotry of a country and a nation that has been robbed of its past and identity,In the last 25 years everything was sold and destroyed, our factories, our gold, our oil, Corruption grew and grew and it became a way of life, from the tiny to the huge: everywhere you go you have to bribe someone, From the school secretaries who will not stamp your student licence (that gives you 50% off on all public transport) if you do not bring coffee and flowers, to the top officials and heads of state,As the population became more and more angry they started protesting, The answer of our officials was: Who doesn't like it here is free to go, The result: 20% fewer doctors in 5 years, all our highly qualified brains have left, because they were invited to leave the country from our heads of state,Others with college degrees went abroad to Italy and Spain to pick strawberries and send money home to thier families to survive, There is a whole generation that will come after us of children who grew up without parents, A psychologically damaged generation of children who grew up alone or raised by relatives,They robbed our identity, invited everyone who spoke against the system to leave the country and crushed the spirit of our nation,Our future: no doctors, no engineers, no parents and no hope, This is the result of the last 25 years, No past, no present, no future,"The day we give up is the day we die"The people in the streets are my generation, A generation of experiments, Our grandparents fought in World War II, our parents made a revolution in '89, Now my generation woke up, And we demand that our brothers and sisters come back home and the politicians leave instead, We demand our honour and identity back, Romania is a bomb ticking,This is just the beginning of my generation's revolution,is a term used to distinguish electronic dada from 'traditional' dada, It is a portmanteau word deriving from 'Multimedia dADA',For more see:
