    "\"Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,\" said Baynes. \"If you\r\nlook it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and\r\nwhite, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes.

    "\"The indications are ruined by three days' #NN#.  They may mean\r\nsomething or nothing.  Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can\r\nhelp us further.  It is a small #NN# which we have gathered. Let us see\r\nif we can do better in London.\"",
    "#RB# we added one more #NN# to our #NN# before we left Woolwich\r\nStation.  The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with\r\nconfidence that he saw Cadogan #NN# he knew well by #NN#\r\nthe Monday night, and that he went to London by the #CD#:#CD# to London\r\nBridge.  He was alone and took a single #JJ# ticket.  The clerk\r\nwas struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner.  So #JJ# was\r\nhe that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped\r\nhim with it.  A reference to the #NN# showed that the 8:15 was the\r\nfirst train which it was possible for West to take after he had left\r\nthe lady about 7:30.",
    "\"Let us #VB#, Watson,\" said Holmes after half an hour of\r\nsilence.  \"I am not aware that in all our #JJ# researches we have ever\r\nhad a case which was more difficult to get at.  Every fresh advance\r\nwhich we make only reveals a fresh #NN# beyond. And yet we have surely\r\nmade some #JJ# #NN#.",
    "\"The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against\r\nyoung Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend\r\nthemselves to a more #NN# hypothesis.  Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that he had been #VBD# by some foreign agent.  It might\r\nhave been done under such #NNS# as would have prevented him from\r\nspeaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the\r\ndirection indicated by his remarks to his fiancee.  Very good.  We will\r\nnow suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he\r\nsuddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the\r\ndirection of the office. He was an #JJ# man, quick in his\r\n#NNS#.  Everything gave way to his duty.  He followed the man,\r\nreached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued\r\nthe thief.  In this way we get over the objection that no one would\r\ntake originals when he could make copies.  This #NN# had to take\r\noriginals. So far it holds together.\"",
    "\"What is the next step?\"",
    "\"Then we come into difficulties.  One would imagine that under such\r\ncircumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to #VB# the\r\nvillain and #VB# the alarm.  Why did he not do so? Could it have been\r\nan official superior who took the papers? That would explain West's\r\n#NN#.  Or could the chief have given West the #NN# in the fog, and\r\nWest started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms,\r\n#VBG# that he knew where the rooms were?  The #NN# must have been\r\nvery #VBG#, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no\r\neffort to #VB# with her.  Our scent runs cold here, and there is\r\na #JJ# #NN# between either hypothesis and the #VBG# of West's body,\r\nwith seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.\r\nMy instinct now is to work from the other end.  If Mycroft has given us\r\nthe list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two\r\n#VBZ# #RB# of one.\"",
    "Surely enough, a note #VBD# us at Baker Street.  A government\r\nmessenger had brought it #NN#.  Holmes glanced at it and threw it\r\nover to me.",
    "There are numerous small #NN#, but few who would #VB# so big an\r\naffair.  The only men worth considering are #NNP# #NNP#, of #CD# Great\r\nGeorge Street, #NNP#; #NNP# #NNP# #NN#, of #NN# #NNS#,\r\n#VBG# #NNP#; and #NNP# #NN#, 13 #NNP# #NNPS#, Kensington.\r\nThe latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as\r\nhaving left.  #JJ# to hear you have seen some light.

    "\"Excellent.  Let me give you a short #NN# of what I have done, with\r\nsome indication of what we are about to do.  Now it must be evident to\r\nyou, Watson, that this young man's body was #VBN# on the roof of the\r\ntrain.

    "\"Could it not have been dropped from a #NN#?\"",
    "\"I should say it was impossible.  If you examine the #NNS# you will\r\nfind that they are slightly #VBN#, and there is no #VBG# round\r\nthem.  Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was\r\nplaced on it.\"",
    "\"How could he be placed there?\"",
    "\"That was the question which we had to answer.  There is only one\r\npossible way.  You are aware that the Underground runs clear of #NNS#\r\nat some points in the West #NN#.

    "\"It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.  Let us walk,\" said\r\nhe.  \"Don't drop the instruments, I beg.  Your arrest as a #JJ#\r\ncharacter would be a most #JJ# #NN#.\"",

    "A minute later we were both in the area.  Hardly had we reached the\r\ndark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog\r\nabove.

There he lay in the hall, and we were at\r\nour wit's end what to do.  Then Oberstein had this idea about the\r\ntrains which halted under his back window.  But first he examined the\r\npapers which I had brought.  He said that three of them were essential,\r\nand that he must keep them.  'You cannot keep them,' said I.  'There\r\nwill be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.'  'I must\r\nkeep them,' said he, 'for they are so technical that it is impossible\r\nin the time to make copies.' 'Then they must all #NN# back together\r\nto-night,' said I.  He thought for a little, and then he cried out that\r\nhe had it. '#NN# I will keep,' said he.  'The others we will #NN#\r\ninto the pocket of this young man.  When he is found the whole business\r\nwill #RB# be put to his account.'  I could see no other way out of\r\nit, so we did as he suggested.  We waited half an hour at the window\r\nbefore a train stopped.

Miss Cushing was sitting in\r\nthe front room, into which we were ushered.  She was a #VBN#\r\nwoman, with large, #JJ# eyes, and #JJ# hair curving down over her\r\n#NNS# on each side.  A #VBN# #NN# lay upon her #NN# and a\r\n#NN# of coloured #NN# stood upon a stool beside her.",

    "It was a small shed in the #JJ# garden which ran behind the house.\r\nLestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a #NN#\r\nof brown paper and some string.

    "\"#RB#.  It is a piece of tarred #NN#.  You have also, no doubt,\r\nremarked that Miss Cushing has cut the #NN# with a scissors, as can be\r\nseen by the double #NN# on each side.  This is of importance.\"",
    "\"I cannot see the importance,\" said Lestrade.",
    "\"The importance lies in the fact that the #NN# is left #JJ#, and that\r\nthis knot is of a #JJ# character.\"",
    "\"It is very neatly #VBN#.  I had already made a note of that effect,\"\r\nsaid Lestrade #RB#.",
    "\"So much for the str#PRP#ng, then,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"now for the box\r\n#NN#. #NNP# paper, with a #JJ# #NN# of coffee. What, did #NNP#ou\r\nnot observe it?

It is filled with rough salt of\r\nthe quality used for #VBG# #NNS# and other of the #NN#\r\n#JJ# #NNS#.  And #VBN# in it are these very singular\r\n#NNS#.\"",
    "He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a #NN# across his\r\n#NN# he examined them #RB#, while Lestrade and I, bending forward\r\non each side of him, glanced #RB# at these dreadful relics and\r\nat the thoughtful, eager face of our companion.  Finally he returned\r\nthem to the box once more and sat for a while in deep #NN#.",
    "\"You have observed, of course,\" said he at last, \"that the ears are not\r\na #NN#.\"",
    "\"Yes, I have noticed that.  But if this were the practical joke of some\r\nstudents from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to\r\nsend two #JJ# ears as a pair.\"",
    "\"Precisely.  But this is not a practical joke.\"",
    "\"You are sure of it?\"",
    "\"The #NN# is strongly against it.  #NNS# in the\r\ndissecting-rooms are #VBN# with #JJ# #NN#.  These ears bear\r\nno signs of this.  They are fresh, too.  They have been cut off with a\r\n#NN# instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it.\r\nAgain, #NN# or #VBN# #NNS# would be the #NN# which\r\nwould suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt.\r\nI #VB# that there is no practical joke here, but that we are\r\ninvestigating a serious crime.\"",
    "A vague #NN# ran through me as I #VBD# to my companion's words and\r\nsaw the #JJ# gravity which had #VBN# his features. This #JJ#\r\n#JJ# seemed to shadow #RB# some strange and inexplicable horror\r\nin the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is\r\nonly half convinced.",
    "\"There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,\" said he, \"but\r\nthere are much stronger reasons against the other.  We know that this\r\nwoman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for\r\nthe last twenty years.  She has hardly been away from her home for a\r\nday during that time.  Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her\r\nthe #NNS# of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most #JJ#\r\n#NN#, she #VBZ# quite as little of the matter as we do?\"",
    "\"That is the problem which we have to solve,\" Holmes answered, \"and for\r\nmy part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct,\r\nand that a double murder has been committed.  One of these ears is a\r\nwoman's, small, #RB# #VBN#, and #VBN# for an #VBG#.  The other\r\nis a man's, #JJ#, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring.\r\nThese two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their\r\nstory before now.  #NN# is #NNP#.  The packet was posted on Thursday\r\nmorning.  The tragedy, then, occurred on #NNP# or Tuesday, or\r\nearlier.  If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would\r\nhave sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing?  We may take it that\r\nthe sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some\r\nstrong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet.  What reason then?\r\nIt must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to #NN# her,\r\nperhaps.  But in that case she knows who it is.  Does she know?  I\r\ndoubt it.  If she knew, why should she call the police in?  She might\r\nhave #VBN# the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is\r\nwhat she would have done if she had wished to #NN# the criminal.  But\r\nif she does not wish to shield him she would give his name.  There is a\r\ntangle here which needs #VBG# out.\"  He had been talking in a\r\nhigh, quick voice, staring #RB# up over the garden #NN#, but now he\r\nsprang #RB# to his feet and walked towards the house.",
    "\"I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\" said he.",
    "\"In that case I may leave you here,\" said Lestrade, \"for I have another\r\nsmall business on hand.  I think that I have nothing further to learn\r\nfrom Miss Cushing.  You will find me at the police-station.\"",
    "\"We shall look in on our way to the train,\" answered Holmes.  A moment\r\nlater he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady\r\nwas still quietly working away at her antimacassar.  She put it down on\r\nher lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, #VBG# blue\r\neyes.",
    "\"I am convinced, sir,\" she said, \"that this matter is a #NN#, and\r\nthat the parcel was never meant for me at all.

    "\"There were one or two #NN#\"",
    "\"Oh, I am #JJ# of questions!\" cried Miss Cushing impatiently.",
    "\"You have two #NNS#, I believe.\"",

    "\"Ah, the #NN#, perhaps?\"",
    "\"No, the May Day, when last I heard.  #NNP# came down here to see me\r\nonce.

    "\"Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.\"",
    "\"I did not wish her to tell me anything.  I only wanted to look at her.\r\nHowever, I think that I have got all that I want.  #NNP# us to some\r\ndecent #NN#, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we\r\nshall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.\"",
    "We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk\r\nabout nothing but #NNS#, #VBG# with great exultation how he had\r\n#VBN# his own #NNS#, which was worth at least five hundred\r\n#NNS#, at a #NNP# #NN#'s in #NN# #NNP# Road for #NN#\r\n#NNS#.  This led him to #NNS#, and we sat for an hour over a\r\nbottle of #NN# while he told me #NN# after anecdote of that\r\nextraordinary man.  The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare\r\nhad #VBD# into a #JJ# #NN# before we found ourselves at the\r\npolice-station.  Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.",
    "\"A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.",
    "\"#NNP#!  It is the answer!\"  He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it,\r\nand #JJ# it into his pocket.  \"That's all right,\" said he.",
    "\"Have you found out anything?\"",
    "\"I have found out everything!\"",
    "\"What!\" Lestrade stared at him in amazement.  \"You are #VBG#.\"",
    "\"I was never more serious in my life.  A #JJ# crime has been\r\ncommitted, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.\"",
    "\"And the criminal?\"",
    "Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards\r\nand threw it over to Lestrade.",
    "\"That is the name,\" he said.  \"You cannot effect an arrest until\r\nto-morrow night at the #JJS#.  I should #VBP# that you do not\r\n#VB# my name at all in connection with the case, as I #VB# to be\r\nonly #VBN# with those crimes which present some difficulty in\r\ntheir solution.  Come on, Watson.\"  We #VBD# off together to the\r\nstation, leaving Lestrade still staring with a #VBN# face at the\r\ncard which Holmes had thrown him.",
    "\"The case,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars that\r\nnight in our rooms at Baker Street, \"is one where, as in the\r\ninvestigations which you have #VBD# under the names of 'A #NNP# in\r\n#NNP#' and of 'The #NNP# of #NN#,' we have been #VBN# to reason\r\n#RB# from #NNS# to #NNS#.  I have written to Lestrade asking him\r\nto supply us with the details which are now #VBG#, and which he will\r\nonly get after he had #VBN# his man.  That he may be safely trusted\r\nto do, for #IN# he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as\r\n#JJ# as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and\r\nindeed, it is just this #NN# which has brought him to the top at\r\nScotland Yard.\"",
    "\"Your case is not complete, then?\" I asked.",
    "\"It is fairly complete in essentials.  We know who the author of the\r\nrevolting business is, although one of the victims still #NNS# us.\r\nOf course, you have formed your own conclusions.\"",
    "\"I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is\r\nthe man whom you suspect?\"",
    "\"Oh! it is more than a suspicion.\"",
    "\"And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.\"",
    "\"On the #JJ#, to my mind nothing could be more clear.  Let me run\r\nover the #JJ# steps.  We approached the case, you remember, with\r\nan absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage.  We had formed\r\nno theories.  We were simply there to observe and to #VB# #NNS#\r\nfrom our #NNS#.  What did we see first?  A very placid and\r\nrespectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a\r\nportrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters.  It\r\ninstantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for\r\none of these.  I set the idea aside as one which could be #VBN# or\r\n#VBD# at our #NN#.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember,\r\nand we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box.",
    "\"The string was of the quality which is used by #NN# aboard\r\nship, and at once a #NN# of the sea was #JJ# in our\r\ninvestigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which is #JJ#\r\nwith #NNS#, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the\r\n#JJ# #NN# was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among\r\nsailors than #NN#, I was quite certain that all the #NNS# in the\r\ntragedy were to be found among our #JJ# #NNS#.",
    "\"When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it\r\nwas to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the #JJS# sister would, of course, be\r\nMiss Cushing, and although her #JJ# was 'S' it might #VB# to one\r\nof the others as well.  In that case we should have to #VB# our\r\ninvestigation from a fresh #NN# altogether.  I therefore went into the\r\nhouse with the #NN# of clearing up this point.  I was about to\r\nassure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made\r\nwhen you may remember that I came suddenly to a #NN#.  The fact was\r\nthat I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the\r\nsame time #VBD# the field of our inquiry #RB#.",
    "\"As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the\r\nbody which #VBZ# so much as the human ear.  Each ear is as a #NN#\r\nquite distinctive and #VBZ# from all other ones.  In last year's\r\n#JJ# #JJ# you will find two short #NNS# from my pen\r\nupon the subject.  I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with\r\nthe eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their #JJ#\r\n#NNS#.  #VB# my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss\r\nCushing I #VBN# that her ear #VBD# exactly with the female\r\near which I had just #VBN#.  The matter was entirely beyond\r\ncoincidence.  There was the same #VBG# of the #NN#, the same\r\nbroad curve of the upper #NN#, the same #NN# of the inner\r\n#NN#.  In all essentials it was the same ear.",
    "\"In the first place, her sister's name was Sarah, and her address had\r\nuntil recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the\r\nmistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard\r\nof this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had\r\nat one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone\r\nup to Liverpool to be near the #NNS#, but a quarrel had afterwards\r\n#VBN# them.  This quarrel had put a stop to all #NNS# for\r\nsome months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to\r\nMiss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.",
    "\"And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully.  We\r\nhad learned of the existence of this steward, an #JJ# man, of\r\nstrong #NN# remember that he threw up what must have been a\r\nvery superior #NN# in order to be nearer to his #NN#, too, to\r\noccasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his\r\nwife had been murdered, and that a #RB# a seafaring #NN#\r\nbeen murdered at the same time.  #NN#, of course, at once #VBZ#\r\nitself as the motive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the\r\ndeed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  #RB# because during her\r\n#NN# in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events\r\nwhich led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line of boats\r\ncall at Belfast, #NNP#, and #NNP#; so that, presuming that Browner\r\nhad committed the deed and had #VBD# at once upon his #NN#, the\r\nMay Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his\r\nterrible packet.",
    "\"A second solution was at this stage #RB# possible, and although I\r\nthought it exceedingly #RB#, I was determined to #NN# it\r\nbefore going further.  An #JJ# #NN# might have killed Mr. and\r\nMrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband.\r\nThere were many grave objections to this theory, but it was\r\nconceivable.  I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend #NN#, of\r\nthe Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at\r\nhome, and if Browner had #VBD# in the May Day.  Then we went on to\r\nWallington to visit Miss Sarah.",
    "\"I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had\r\nbeen #VBN# in her.  Then, of course, she might give us very\r\nimportant information, but I was not #JJ# that she would.  She must\r\nhave heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was\r\nringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the\r\npacket was meant.  If she had been #JJ# to help justice she would\r\nprobably have #VBN# with the police already.  However, it was\r\nclearly our duty to see her, so we went.  We found that the news of the\r\narrival of the #NN# her #NN# dated from that #NN# such\r\nan effect upon her as to bring on brain fever.  It was #JJR# than\r\never that she understood its full #NN#, but equally clear that\r\nwe should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.",
    "\"However, we were really #JJ# of her help.  Our answers were\r\nwaiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to\r\nsend them.  Nothing could be more #JJ#.  Mrs. Browner's house had\r\nbeen closed for more than three days, and the #NNS# were of\r\nopinion that she had gone south to see her #NNS#.  It had been\r\n#VBN# at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the\r\nMay Day, and I #VB# that she is due in the Thames #NN# night.\r\nWhen he #VBZ# he will be met by the #JJ# but #JJ# Lestrade, and\r\nI have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.\"",

It\r\nwas indeed this #NN# upon the part of my friend and certainly not\r\nany #NN# of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\r\nlay very few of my #NNS# before the public.  My participation in some\r\nof his adventures was always a #NN# which #VBD# #NN# and\r\n#NN# upon me.",
    "It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\r\nfrom Holmes last #NN# has never been known to write where a\r\ntelegram would #VB# the following terms:",
    "Why not tell them of the #NNP# #NN# case I have #VBN#.",
    "I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\r\nfresh to his mind, or what #NN# had caused him to desire that I should\r\n#VB# it; but I hasten, before another #VBG# telegram may\r\n#VB#, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\r\ncase and to lay the narrative before my #NNS#.",
    "It was, then, in the spring of the year #CD# that Holmes's iron\r\n#NN# showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of #JJ#\r\nhard work of a most #JJ# kind, #VBN#, perhaps, by occasional\r\n#NNS# of his own.  In March of that year Dr. #NNP# #NN#, of\r\n#NNP# Street, whose #JJ# #NN# to Holmes I may some day\r\nrecount, gave positive #NNS# that the famous private agent lay\r\naside all his cases and #NN# himself to complete rest if he wished\r\nto #VB# an #JJ# #NN#.  The state of his #NN# was not a\r\nmatter in which he himself took the #JJS# interest, for his mental\r\ndetachment was absolute, but he was #VBN# at last, on the #NN# of\r\nbeing permanently #VBN# from work, to give himself a complete\r\nchange of scene and air.  #RB# it was that in the early spring of that\r\nyear we found ourselves together in a small #NN# near #NN# #NNP#, at\r\nthe further #NN# of the Cornish #NN#.",
    "It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the #JJ#\r\n#NN# of my patient.  From the windows of our little #VBN#\r\nhouse, which stood high upon a #JJ# #NN#, we looked down upon the\r\nwhole sinister #NN# of #NNS# Bay, that old death trap of #VBG#\r\n#NNS#, with its #NN# of black #NNS# and #NN# #NNS# on which\r\n#JJ# #NNS# have met their end.  With a #RB# #NN# it lies\r\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the #VBN# craft to #NN# into it\r\nfor rest and protection.",
    "Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the #VBG# #NN# from\r\nthe #NN#, the #VBG# #NN#, the #NN# shore, and the last #NN#\r\nin the #VBG# #NNS#.  The wise #NN# stands far out from that\r\nevil place.",
    "On the land side our #NNS# were as sombre as on the sea. It was\r\na country of #VBG# #NNS#, lonely and #VBN#, with an occasional\r\nchurch #NN# to mark the #NN# of some #JJ# village.  In every\r\ndirection upon these #NN#s there were t#NN#s of some #VBN# race\r\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its #JJ# record strange\r\n#NNS# of stone, irregular #NNS# which contained the burned #NNS#\r\nof the dead, and curious #NNS# which #VBD# at #JJ# #NN#.\r\nThe #NN# and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\r\n#VBN# #NNS#, #VBD# to the #NN# of my friend, and he\r\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary #NNS# upon the\r\nmoor. The ancient Cornish #NN# had also arrested his attention, and\r\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was #JJ# to the\r\n#NN#, and had been #RB# #VBN# from the #JJ# #NNS# in\r\ntin.  He had received a #NN# of books upon #NN# and was\r\nsettling down to #VB# this #NN# when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\r\nhis #VBN# #NN#, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\r\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\r\n#JJ#, and #RB# more mysterious than any of those which had\r\ndriven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, #JJ# #JJ#\r\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the #NN# of\r\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\r\n#NNP# but #IN# the whole west of England. Many of my readers\r\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The\r\nCornish #NNP#,\" though a most #JJ# account of the matter reached\r\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\r\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.",
    "I have said that #VBN# #NNS# #VBN# the #NNS# which #VBN# this\r\npart of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the #NN# of #NN#\r\n#NNS#, where the #NNS# of a couple of hundred inhabitants #VBN#\r\nround an ancient, #NN# church.  The #NN# of the #NN#, Mr.\r\n#NN#, was something of an #NN#, and as such Holmes had\r\nmade his acquaintance. He was a #JJ# man, portly and #JJ#,\r\nwith a considerable #NN# of #JJ# #NN#.  At his invitation we had taken\r\ntea at the #NN# and had come to know, also, Mr. #NNP# #NNS#,\r\nan independent gentleman, who #VBN# the #NN#'s #JJ#\r\n#NNS# by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,\r\nbeing a bachelor, was glad to come to such an #NN#, though he\r\nhad little in common with his #NN#, who was a thin, dark, #VBN#\r\nman, with a #NN# which gave the impression of actual, physical\r\n#NN#.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar\r\n#JJ#, but his lodger strangely #JJ#, a #VBN#,\r\n#JJ# man, sitting with #VBN# eyes, brooding apparently upon\r\nhis own #NNS#.",
    "These were #DT#e two men who entered abruptly into our little\r\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the #CD#th, shortly after our breakfast\r\nhour, as we were smoking together, #JJ# to our daily excursion\r\nupon the moors.",
    "\"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an #VBN# voice, \"the most\r\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\r\nthe most #JJ# business.  We can only regard it as a special\r\n#NNP# that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\r\nEngland you are the one man we need.\"",
    "I glared at the #JJ# vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\r\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\r\nwho hears the #NN#.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\r\n#VBG# visitor with his #VBD# companion sat side by side upon\r\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\r\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the #NN# of his dark eyes\r\nshowed that they #VBN# a common #NN#.",
    "\"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.",
    "\"Well, as you seem to have made the #NN#, whatever it may be, and\r\nthe vicar to have had it #JJ#, perhaps you had better do the\r\nspeaking,\" said Holmes.",
    "I glanced at the #RB# #VBN# clergyman, with the #RB# #VBN#\r\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's\r\nsimple #NN# had brought to their faces.",
    "\"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then\r\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\r\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\r\naffair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening\r\nin the company of his two #NNS#, #NNP# and George, and of his sister\r\n#NNP#, at their house of Tredannick #NN#, which is near the old\r\nstone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,\r\n#VBG# cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\r\nspirits. This morning, being an early #NN#, he walked in that\r\ndirection before breakfast and was #VBN# by the carriage of Dr.\r\n#NNP#, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most #JJ#\r\ncall to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\r\nhim.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\r\nstate of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\r\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\r\nthem and the #NNS# burned down to their #NNS#.  The sister lay back\r\n#NN# in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\r\nlaughing, #VBG#, and #VBG#, the senses #VBN# clean out of them.\r\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two #JJ# men, #VBN#\r\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost #NN# #NN# of\r\nterror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the\r\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. #NNP#, the old cook and\r\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\r\nduring the night.  Nothing had been stolen or #VBN#, and there is\r\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\r\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\r\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a #NN#, and if you can help\r\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"",
    "I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\r\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\r\nintense face and #VBD# eyebrows told me how vain was now the\r\n#NN#.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\r\nstrange #NN# which had broken in upon our peace.",
    "\"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,\r\nit would appear to be a case of a very #JJ# nature. Have you\r\nbeen there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"",
    "\"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\r\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"",
    "\"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"",
    "\"About a mile #RB#.\"",
    "\"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you\r\na few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"",
    "The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\r\nmore #VBN# excitement was even greater than the #NN# emotion\r\nof the clergyman.  He sat with a #JJ#, drawn face, his #JJ# #NN#\r\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped #RB# together.\r\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\r\nhad #VBN# his family, and his dark eyes seemed to #VB# something\r\nof the horror of the scene.",
    "\"#VB# what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing\r\nto speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"",
    "\"Tell me about last night.\"",
    "\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I #VBN# there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\r\nbrother George #VBN# a game of #NN# afterwards.  We sat down about\r\nnine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I #VBD# to go.  I left\r\nthem all round the table, as merry as could be.\"",
    "\"Who let you out?\"",
    "\"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall\r\ndoor behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,\r\nbut the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or\r\nwindow this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been\r\nto the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\r\nBrenda lying dead of #NN#, with her head hanging over the arm of the\r\nchair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as\r\nI live.\"",
    "\"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said\r\nHolmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\r\nway account for them?\"",
    "\"It's #JJ#, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is\r\nnot of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed\r\nthe light of reason from their #NNS#.  What human #NN# could do\r\nthat?\"",
    "\"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond #NN# it is\r\ncertainly beyond me.  Yet we must #NN# all natural #NNS#\r\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.\r\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\r\nsince they lived together and you had rooms #RB#?\"",
    "\"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\r\nwere a family of #NNS# at #NN#, but we #VBN# our #NN# to a\r\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that\r\nthere was some feeling about the #NN# of the money and it stood\r\nbetween us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we\r\nwere the best of friends together.\"",
    "\"#VBG# back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\r\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\r\ntragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\r\nme.\"",
    "\"There is nothing at all, sir.\"",
    "\"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"",
    "\"Never better.\"",
    "\"#VBD# they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of\r\ncoming danger?\"",
    "\"Nothing of the kind.\"",
    "\"You have nothing to add then, which could #VB# me?\"",
    "Mortimer Tregennis #VBN# #RB# for a moment.",
    "\"There is one thing #VBZ# to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the\r\ntable my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\r\n#NN# at cards, was #VBG# it.  I saw him once look hard over my\r\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the\r\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\r\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I\r\ncouldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\r\nsomething there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\r\nthat he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"",
    "\"Did you not #VB#?\"",
    "\"No; the matter passed as #JJ#.\"",
    "\"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"",
    "\"None at all.\"",
    "\"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"",
    "\"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\r\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage #VBD#\r\nme.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\r\nmessage.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\r\nlooked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have\r\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\r\nuntil #NN# had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\r\nleast six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across\r\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were\r\nsinging #NNS# of #NNS# and #VBG# like two great #NNS#.  Oh, it\r\nwas awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as\r\na sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\r\nnearly had him on our hands as well.\"",
    "\"#NN# remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\r\n\"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\r\nfurther delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at\r\nfirst sight presented a more singular problem.\"",
    "Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\r\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\r\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\r\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\r\ncountry lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the #NN# of a\r\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove\r\nby us I caught a glimpse through the #VBN# window of a #RB#\r\n#JJ#, #VBG# face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and\r\n#VBG# teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.",
    "\"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are\r\ntaking them to #NN#.\"",
    "We looked with horror after the black carriage, #JJ# upon its way.\r\nThen we turned our steps towards this #VBN# house in which they\r\nhad met their strange fate.",
    "It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\r\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\r\nfilled with spring #NNS#.  #NNP# this garden the window of the\r\nsitting-room #VBD#, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\r\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by #JJ# horror in a single\r\ninstant #VBD# their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\r\namong the #NNS# and along the path before we entered the #NN#.\r\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\r\nthe #NN#, upset its contents, and #VBN# both our feet and the\r\ngarden path.  #IN# the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the #NN# of a young girl, looked\r\nafter the #VBZ# of the family.  She #RB# answered all Holmes's\r\nquestions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her #NNS# had all\r\nbeen in excellent spirits #RB#, and she had never known them more\r\n#JJ# and #JJ#.  She had #VBD# with horror upon entering the\r\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\r\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\r\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a #NN# for\r\nthe doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we #VBD# to see her.\r\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the #NN# carriage.\r\nShe would not herself stay in the house another day and was #VBG#\r\nthat very afternoon to #VB# her family at #NNP#. #NNP#.",
    "We ascended the stairs and #VBN# the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had\r\nbeen a very #JJ# girl, though now #VBG# upon middle age.  Her\r\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\r\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\r\nher last human emotion.  From her bedroom we #VBD# to the\r\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The\r\ncharred ashes of the #JJ# fire lay in the #NN#.  On the table\r\nwere the four #VBD# and #JJ# candles, with the cards scattered\r\nover its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\r\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with\r\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,\r\n#VBG# them up and #VBG# their #NNS#.  He tested how much\r\nof the garden was #JJ#; he examined the floor, the #VBG#, and the\r\n#NN#; but never once did I see that sudden #VBG# of his eyes\r\nand tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some\r\ngleam of light in this #JJ# darkness.",
    "\"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small\r\nroom on a spring evening?\"",
    "Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\r\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do\r\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.",
    "My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that\r\nI shall #VB# that course of #VBG# which you have so often\r\nand so #RB# #VBN#,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,\r\nwe will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new\r\nfactor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts\r\nover in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will\r\ncertainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish\r\nyou both #VBG#.\"",
    "It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu #NN# that Holmes\r\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat #VBD# in his\r\narmchair, his haggard and #NN# face hardly visible amid the blue\r\nswirl of his tobacco #NN#, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\r\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\r\npipe and sprang to his feet.",
    "\"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the\r\ncliffs together and search for flint #NNS#.  We are more likely to\r\nfind them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without\r\nsufficient material is like racing an engine.  It #NNS# itself to\r\npieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, #NN# else will\r\ncome.",
    "\"Now, let us #RB# define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we\r\n#VBN# the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm #NN# of the very\r\nlittle which we #VB# know, so that when fresh facts #VB# we may be ready\r\nto fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that\r\nneither of us is prepared to admit #JJ# #NNS# into the\r\naffairs of men.  Let us begin by #VBG# that entirely out of our minds.\r\nVery good.  There remain three persons who have been #RB#\r\nstricken by some #JJ# or #JJ# human #NN#.  That is firm\r\nground.  Now, when did this #NN#?  #RB#, #VBG# his narrative\r\nto be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\r\nthe room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it\r\nwas within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the\r\ntable. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\r\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,\r\nthat the #NN# was immediately after his departure, and not later\r\nthan eleven o'clock last night.",
    "\"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\r\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no\r\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my #NNS# as\r\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat #JJ# #NN#\r\n#JJ# by which I #VBN# a clearer impress of his foot than might\r\n#RB# have been possible.  The #JJ#, #JJ# path took it #RB#.\r\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\r\n#VBG# obtained a #NN# #NN# pick out his track among\r\nothers and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away\r\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.",
    "\"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\r\noutside person affected the #NNS#, how can we reconstruct that\r\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter\r\nmay be #VBN#.  She is evidently #JJ#.  Is there any evidence\r\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner #VBN#\r\nso #JJ# an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\r\nsenses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\r\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some #NN#\r\nin the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was #JJ#,\r\n#JJ#, and dark.  #NN# who had the design to alarm these people\r\nwould be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he\r\ncould be seen.  There is a #JJ# #NN# outside this\r\nwindow, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,\r\nthen, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon\r\nthe company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and\r\n#VB# an attempt.  You #VB# our difficulties, Watson?\"",
    "\"They are only too clear,\" I answered with #NN#.",
    "\"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\r\n#JJ#,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your #JJ#\r\n#NNS#, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as #JJ#.\r\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more #JJ# data are\r\n#JJ#, and #VB# the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\r\n#JJ# man.\"",
    "I may have #VBD# upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but\r\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\r\nCornwall when for two hours he #VBN# upon #NNS#, #NNS#, and\r\n#NNS#, as #RB# as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\r\nsolution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\r\ncottage that we found a visitor #VBG# us, who soon brought our minds\r\nback to the matter in hand.  #CC# of us needed to be told who that\r\nvisitor was.  The huge body, the #JJ# and deeply #VBN# face with the\r\nfierce eyes and #NN# nose, the grizzled hair which nearly #VBD#\r\nour cottage ceiling, the #NN# at the #NNS# and white near\r\nthe lips, save for the #NN# #NN# from his #JJ# #NN#\r\nthese were as well known in London as in #NNP#, and could only be\r\nassociated with the #JJ# #NN# of Dr. #NNP# #NN#, the\r\ngreat #NN# and #NN#.",
    "We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\r\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the #NN# #NNS#. He made no\r\n#NNS# to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\r\nas it was well known that it was his love of #NN# which caused him\r\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his #NNS# in a\r\nsmall #NN# buried in the lonely #NN# of #NN# #NN#.  Here,\r\namid his books and his #NNS#, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\r\n#VBG# to his own simple wants and #VBG# little #JJ# #VB# to\r\nthe affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\r\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\r\nadvance in his #NN# of this mysterious #NN#.  \"The #NN#\r\npolice are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider\r\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim\r\nto being taken into your confidence is that during my many #NNS#\r\nhere I have come to know this family of Tregennis very #VBN#,\r\nupon my Cornish mother's side I could call them #NN# their\r\nstrange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you\r\nthat I had got as far as #NNP# upon my way to Africa, but the news\r\nreached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the\r\ninquiry.\"",
    "Holmes raised his eyebrows.",
    "\"Did you #VB# your boat through it?\"",
    "\"I will take the next.\"",
    "\"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"",
    "\"I tell you they were relatives.\"",
    "\"Quite #NN# of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"",
    "\"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"",
    "\"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the\r\nPlymouth morning papers.\"",
    "\"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"",
    "\"Might I ask from whom?\"",
    "A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.",
    "\"You are very #JJ#, Mr. Holmes.\"",
    "\"It is my business.\"",
    "With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his #VBN# composure.",
    "\"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,\r\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"",
    "\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original\r\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\r\nthis case, but that I have every hope of #VBG# some conclusion.  It\r\nwould be #JJ# to say more.\"",
    "\"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\r\nparticular direction?\"",
    "\"No, I can hardly answer that.\"",
    "\"Then I have wasted my time and need not #VB# my visit.\"  The famous\r\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable #NN#, and within\r\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the\r\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\r\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\r\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.",
    "\"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it\r\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's\r\naccount was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night\r\nthere, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to\r\nAfrica, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do\r\nyou make of that, Watson?\"",
    "\"He is deeply #JJ#.\"",
    "\"#RB# #NN#.  There is a #NN# here which we had not yet\r\n#VBN# and which might lead us through the tangle.  #NNP# up, Watson,\r\nfor I am very sure that our material has not yet all #NN# to hand.\r\nWhen it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"",
    "#NNP# did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be #VBD#, or\r\nhow strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up\r\nan entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was #VBG# at my window in\r\nthe morning when I heard the rattle of #NNS# and, looking up, saw a\r\n#NN# coming at a #NN# down the road.  It pulled up at our door,\r\nand our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden\r\npath. Holmes was already dressed, and we #VBD# down to meet him.",
    "Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last\r\nin #NNS# and #NNS# his tragic story came out of him.",
    "\"We are #NN#, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he\r\ncried.  \"#NNP# himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his\r\nhands!\"  He #VBD# about in his #NN#, a #JJ# object if it\r\nwere not for his #NN# face and #VBN# eyes.  Finally he shot out his\r\nterrible news.",
    "\"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the\r\nsame symptoms as the rest of his family.\"",
    "Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.",
    "\"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"",
    "\"Yes, I can.\"",
    "\"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are\r\nentirely at your disposal.  #NN#, before things get\r\ndisarranged.\"",
    "The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an #NN#\r\nby themselves, the one above the other.  #IN# was a large\r\nsitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a #NN# lawn\r\nwhich came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the\r\npolice, so that everything was absolutely #JJ#.  Let me describe\r\nexactly the scene as we saw it upon that #JJ# March morning.  It has\r\nleft an impression which can never be #VBN# from my mind.",
    "The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing #NN#.\r\nThe servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would\r\nhave been even more #JJ#.  This might partly be due to the fact\r\nthat a lamp stood #VBG# and smoking on the centre table.  #IN# it\r\nsat the dead man, #JJ#ing back in his chair, his thin beard #VBG#,\r\nhis spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face\r\nturned towards the window and twisted into the same #NN# of\r\nterror which had marked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs\r\nwere convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a\r\nvery #NN# of fear.  He was fully #VBN#, though there were signs\r\nthat his #VBG# had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned\r\nthat his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him\r\nin the early morning.",
    "One realized the red-hot energy which #VBP# Holmes's #NN#\r\n#JJ# when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\r\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was #JJ#\r\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs #VBG# with\r\neager #NN#.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\r\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\r\nfoxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a #JJ# cast #IN#\r\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\r\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\r\n#NNS# of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,\r\nout through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn,\r\nsprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the\r\n#NN# who is at the very heels of his #NN#.  The lamp, which was an\r\nordinary #JJ#, he examined with minute care, making certain\r\n#NNS# upon its #NN#.  He carefully #VBN# with his lens the\r\n#NN# shield which covered the top of the #NN# and #VBD# off some\r\nashes which #VBN# to its upper surface, putting some of them into an\r\nenvelope, which he placed in his #NN#.  Finally, just as the\r\ndoctor and the official police put in an appearance, he #VBD# to the\r\nvicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.",
    "\"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\"\r\nhe remarked.  \"I cannot remain to #VB# the matter with the police,\r\nbut I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give\r\nthe inspector my #NNS# and direct his attention to the bedroom\r\nwindow and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together\r\nthey are almost conclusive.  If the police would #VB# further\r\ninformation I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And\r\nnow, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\r\nelsewhere.\"",
    "It may be that the police #VBD# the #NN# of an amateur, or that\r\nthey imagined themselves to be upon some #JJ# line of investigation;\r\nbut it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two\r\ndays.  #IN# this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and\r\n#VBG# in the cottage; but a greater #NN# in country walks which\r\nhe undertook alone, #VBG# after many hours without remark as to\r\nwhere he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his\r\ninvestigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\r\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\r\nthe tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the\r\nvicarage, and he carefully #VBN# the #NN# which it would take to be\r\n#VBN#. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant\r\nnature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.",
    "\"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is\r\na single common point of resemblance in the #VBG# #NNS# which have\r\nreached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in\r\neach case upon those who had first entered it.  You will #VBP# that\r\nMortimer Tregennis, in #VBG# the episode of his last visit to his\r\nbrother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell\r\ninto a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was\r\nso. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told\r\nus that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards\r\nopened the window.  In the second #NN# of Mortimer Tregennis\r\n#NN# cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room\r\nwhen we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That\r\nservant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.\r\nYou will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each\r\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also,\r\nthere is #NN# going on in the #NN# the one case a fire, in\r\nthe other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was #NNS# a\r\n#NN# of the oil #VBN# will #NN# after it was broad\r\ndaylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three\r\n#NN# burning, the #JJ# atmosphere, and, finally, the madness\r\nor death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"",
    "\"It would appear so.\"",
    "\"At least we may #VB# it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose,\r\nthen, that something was burned in each case which produced an\r\natmosphere #VBG# strange #JJ# effects.  Very good. In the first\r\n#NN# of the Tregennis #NNS# #NN# was placed in\r\nthe fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry\r\n#NNS# to some #NN# up the chimney.  #RB# one would expect the\r\neffects of the #NN# to be less than in the second case, where there\r\nwas less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to #VB# that it\r\nwas so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the\r\nmore sensitive #NN#, was killed, the others exhibiting that\r\ntemporary or #JJ# #NN# which is evidently the first effect of\r\nthe drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts,\r\ntherefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which #VBD# by\r\ncombustion.",
    "\"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in\r\nMortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The\r\nobvious place to look was the talc #NN# or #NN# of the lamp.\r\nThere, sure enough, I perceived a number of #JJ# ashes, and round the\r\n#NNS# a fringe of #JJ# #NN#, which had not yet been consumed.\r\n#NN# of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"",
    "\"Why half, Holmes?\"",
    "\"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official\r\npolice force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison\r\nstill remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson,\r\nwe will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open\r\nour window to #VB# the premature #NN# of two #JJ# members of\r\nsociety, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an\r\narmchair unless, like a sensible man, you #VB# to have nothing to\r\ndo with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I\r\nknew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may\r\nbe the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we\r\nwill leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to\r\nbring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem #JJ#.  Is\r\nthat all clear?  Well, then, I take our #NN# what remains of\r\n#NN# the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now,\r\nWatson, let us sit down and await developments.\"",
    "They were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before\r\nI was conscious of a thick, #NN# #NN#, subtle and #JJ#.  At the\r\nvery first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all\r\n#NN#.  A thick, black #NN# #VBD# before my eyes, and my mind told\r\nme that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my\r\n#VBN# senses, #VBD# all that was vaguely horrible, all that was\r\n#JJ# and #RB# #JJ# in the universe.  #JJ# #NNS#\r\nswirled and #VBD# amid the dark cloud-bank, each a #NN# and a warning\r\nof something coming, the #NN# of some #JJ# #NN# upon the\r\n#NN#, whose very shadow would #VB# my soul.  A #VBG# horror\r\ntook possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes\r\nwere #VBG#, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather.\r\nThe #NN# within my brain was such that something must surely #VB#.\r\nI tried to #VB# and was vaguely aware of some #JJ# #NN# which was\r\nmy own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment,\r\nin some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had\r\na glimpse of Holmes's face, white, #JJ#, and drawn with #NN#\r\nvery look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that\r\nvision which gave me an instant of #NN# and of #NN#.  I dashed\r\nfrom my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we #VBD#\r\nthrough the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down\r\nupon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the\r\n#JJ# sunshine which was #VBG# its way through the #NN# cloud\r\nof terror which had #NN# us in. #RB# it rose from our #NNS# like the\r\nmists from a #NN# until peace and reason had returned, and we were\r\nsitting upon the grass, #VBG# our #JJ# #NNS#, and looking with\r\napprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific\r\nexperience which we had #VBN#.",
    "\"#IN# my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an #JJ# voice, \"I\r\nowe you both my thanks and an #NN#.  It was an #JJ#\r\nexperiment even for one's self, and #RB# so for a friend.  I am\r\nreally very sorry.\"",
    "\"You know,\" I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much\r\nof Holmes's heart before, \"that it is my greatest joy and privilege to\r\nhelp you.\"",
    "He relapsed at once into the #NNS#, #NN# #NN# which was\r\nhis #JJ# attitude to those about him.  \"It would be #JJ# to\r\ndrive us mad, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"A #JJ# observer would\r\ncertainly #VB# that we were so already before we embarked upon so\r\nwild an experiment.  I confess that I never imagined that the effect\r\ncould be so sudden and so #JJ#.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and,\r\n#VBG# with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw\r\nit among a bank of #NNS#. \"We must give the room a little time to\r\nclear.  I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt\r\nas to how these #NNS# were produced?\"",
    "\"None whatever.\"",
    "\"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the #NN# here\r\nand let us discuss it together.  That #JJ# stuff seems still to\r\n#VB# round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence\r\npoints to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the\r\nfirst tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must\r\nremember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family\r\nquarrel, followed by a #NN#.  How bitter that quarrel may\r\nhave been, or how #JJ# the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I\r\nthink of Mortimer Tregennis, with the #NN# face and the small #JJ#,\r\n#JJ# eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge\r\nto be of a particularly #VBG# #NN#. Well, in the next place,\r\nyou will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which\r\ntook our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy,\r\n#VBD# from him.  He had a motive in #JJ# us.  Finally, if he\r\ndid not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the\r\nroom, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his\r\ndeparture. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have\r\nrisen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not\r\narrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the\r\nevidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"",
    "\"Then his own death was #NN#!\"",
    "\"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible #NN#.\r\nThe man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate\r\nupon his own family might well be driven by #NN# to #VB# it upon\r\nhimself.  There are, however, some #NN# reasons against it.\r\nFortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I\r\nhave made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon\r\nfrom his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you\r\nwould kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been #VBG#\r\na #JJ# experiment #NNS# which has left our little room hardly fit\r\nfor the #NN# of so #VBN# a visitor.\"",
    "I had heard the #NN# of the garden gate, and now the #JJ# figure\r\nof the great #JJ# explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in\r\nsome surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.",
    "\"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I\r\nhave come, though I really do not know why I should #VB# your summons.\"",
    "\"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes.\r\n\"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous #NN#.\r\nYou will excuse this #JJ# reception in the open air, but my friend\r\nWatson and I have nearly furnished an #JJ# #NN# to what the\r\npapers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for\r\nthe present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will\r\naffect you #RB# in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we\r\nshould talk where there can be no #VBG#.\"",
    "The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed #RB# at my\r\ncompanion.",

    "For a moment I wished that I were #VBN#.  Sterndale's fierce face\r\nturned to a #JJ# red, his eyes glared, and the #JJ#, passionate\r\nveins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with\r\nclenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a\r\nviolent effort he resumed a cold, rigid #NN#, which was, perhaps,\r\nmore suggestive of danger than his hot-headed #NN#.",
    "\"I have lived so long among #NNS# and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that\r\nI have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well,\r\nMr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"",
    "\"#CC# have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the\r\n#JJS# proof of it is that, #VBG# what I know, I have sent for you\r\nand not for the police.\"",

    "\"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is #NN# upon your\r\npart, Mr. Holmes, you have #VBN# a bad man for your experiment. Let us\r\nhave no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"",
    "\"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that\r\nI hope #NN# may #VB# frankness.  What my next step may be will\r\n#VB# entirely upon the nature of your own #NN#.\"",

    "\"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon\r\nSterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the\r\nfacts upon which my conclusions are #VBN#.

    "\"I have heard your reasons and regard them as #JJ# and\r\n#JJ#.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I\r\nsuspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,\r\nwaited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"",
    "\"How do you know that?\"",
    "\"I followed you.\"",
    "\"I saw no one.\"",
    "\"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a\r\nrestless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in\r\nthe early morning you #VBD# to put into #NN#.

At the\r\nvicarage you passed through the #NN# and the side #VB#, coming out\r\nunder the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the\r\nhousehold was not yet #VBG#.

He was a #RB#, subtle,\r\nscheming man, and several things #VBD# which gave me a suspicion of\r\nhim, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.",
    "\"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I\r\nshowed him some of my African #NNS#.  Among other things I\r\n#VBN# this powder, and I told him of its strange #NNS#, how it\r\n#VBZ# those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and\r\nhow either madness or death is the fate of the #JJ# native who is\r\nsubjected to the ordeal by the #NN# of his #NN#.  I told him also\r\nhow #JJ# European #NN# would be to #VB# it.  How he took it I\r\ncannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it\r\nwas then, while I was opening #NNS# and #VBG# to #NNS#, that he\r\nmanaged to #JJ# some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how\r\nhe #VBD# me with questions as to the #NN# and the time that was\r\nneeded for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a\r\npersonal reason for asking.",
    "\"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me\r\nat Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before\r\nthe news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa.\r\nBut I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details\r\nwithout feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to\r\nsee you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself\r\nto you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer\r\nTregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the\r\nidea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all #JJ#\r\nhe would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\r\ndevil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses,\r\nand killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever\r\nloved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be\r\nhis punishment?",
    "\"Should I #JJ# to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the\r\nfacts were true, but could I help to make a #NN# of #NNS# believe\r\nso fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford\r\nto fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once\r\nbefore, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law,\r\nand that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even\r\nnow.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be\r\nshared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my\r\nown hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon\r\nhis own life than I do at the present moment.",
    "\"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself #VBN# the rest. I did,\r\nas you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I\r\n#VBD# the difficulty of #VBG# him, so I gathered some gravel from\r\nthe #NN# which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his\r\nwindow.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the\r\nsitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had\r\ncome both as judge and #NN#.  The #NN# sank into a chair,\r\n#VBN# at the sight of my revolver.

In five minutes he died.\r\nMy God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he #VBD# nothing\r\nwhich my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story,\r\nMr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much\r\nyourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps\r\nyou like.

    "\"#VB# it down!  #IN#, this instant, Watson--this instant, I say!\" His\r\nhead sank back upon the #NN# and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I\r\n#VBN# the box upon the mantelpiece.  \"I hate to have my things\r\n#VBD#, Watson.

    "The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind.  The\r\nviolent and #NN# excitement, followed by this #NN# of speech,\r\nso far removed from his usual #NN#, showed me how deep was the\r\n#NN# of his mind.  Of all #NNS#, that of a noble mind is the\r\nmost deplorable.  I sat in silent #NN# until the #VBN# time\r\nhad passed.

'If\r\nthe lady who fainted on #NN# #NNS#'#NN# does not interest me.  'Every\r\nday my heart #NN#' #NN#, #VBN# #NN#!  Ah, this is a\r\nlittle more possible.  Listen to this:  '#VB# patient.  Will find some\r\nsure means of communications.  Meanwhile, this column.  G.'  That is\r\ntwo days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived.  It sounds plausible, does\r\nit not?  The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could\r\nnot print it.  Let us see if we can pick up the trace again.  Yes, here\r\nwe #NN# days later.  'Am making successful arrangements.\r\n#NN# and #NN#.  The #NNS# will pass.  G.'  Nothing for a week\r\nafter that.  Then comes something much more definite:  'The path is\r\nclearing.  If I find chance signal message remember code #NN# A,\r\ntwo B, and so on. You will hear soon.  G.'  That was in yesterday's\r\npaper, and there is nothing in to-day's. It's all very #JJ# to\r\nMrs. Warren's lodger.  If we wait a little, Watson, I don't doubt that\r\nthe affair will #VB# more #JJ#.\"",
    "So it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the\r\n#NN# with his back to the fire and a smile of complete\r\nsatisfaction upon his face.",
    "\"How's this, Watson?\" he cried, picking up the paper from the table.\r\n\"'High red house with white stone #NNS#.  #NNP# floor. #JJ# window\r\nleft.  After #NN#.  G.'  That is definite enough. I think after\r\nbreakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's\r\n#NN#.  Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this\r\nmorning?\"",
    "Our client had suddenly burst into the room with an #JJ# energy\r\nwhich told of some new and #JJ# development.",
    "\"It's a police matter, Mr. Holmes!\" she cried.  \"I'll have no more of\r\nit!  He shall pack out of there with his baggage.  I would have gone\r\nstraight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to\r\ntake your opinion first.  But I'm at the end of my patience, and when\r\nit comes to #VBG# my old man #NN#\"",
    "\"#VBG# Mr. Warren about?\"",
    "\"#VBG# him roughly, anyway.\"",
    "\"But who used him roughly?\"",
    "\"Ah! that's what we want to know!  It was this morning, sir.  Mr.\r\nWarren is a #NN# at Morton and #NN#'s, in Tottenham Court\r\nRoad.  He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning\r\nhe had not gone ten #NNS# down the road when two men came up behind\r\nhim, threw a coat over his head, and #VBN# him into a cab that was\r\nbeside the #NN#.  They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and\r\nshot him out.  He lay in the #NN# so shaken in his #NNS# that he\r\nnever saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he\r\nwas on #NN# #NNP#; so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on\r\nhis sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had happened.\"",
    "\"Most interesting,\" said Holmes.  \"Did he observe the appearance of\r\nthese #NN# he hear them talk?\"",
    "\"No; he is clean dazed.  He just knows that he was #VBD# up as if by\r\n#NN# and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe\r\nthree.\"",
    "\"And you #VB# this attack with your lodger?\"",
    "\"Well, we've lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came\r\nbefore.  I've had enough of him.  #NNP#'s not everything. I'll have him\r\nout of my house before the day is done.\"",
    "\"Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren.  Do nothing #NN#. I begin to think that this\r\naffair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight.\r\nIt is clear now that some danger is #VBG# your lodger.  It is\r\nequally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door,\r\n#VBD# your husband for him in the foggy morning light.  On\r\n#VBG# their mistake they #VBN# him. What they would have done\r\nhad it not been a mistake, we can only #NN#.\"",
    "\"Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?\"",
    "\"I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.\"",
    "\"I don't see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door.\r\nI always hear him #VB# it as I go down the stair after I leave the\r\ntray.\"",
    "\"He has to take the tray in.  Surely we could conceal ourselves and see\r\nhim do it.\"",
    "The landlady thought for a moment.",
    "\"Well, sir, there's the #NN# opposite.  I could arrange a\r\n#NN#, maybe, and if you were behind the #NN#\"",
    "\"Excellent!\" said Holmes.  \"When does he lunch?\"",
    "\"About one, sir.\"",
    "\"Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time.  For the present, Mrs.\r\nWarren, #NN#.\"",
    "At #JJ# twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren's\r\n#NN# high, thin, #NN# #NN# in Great #NN# Street, a\r\nnarrow #NN# at the #NN# side of the British Museum.\r\n#VBG# as it does near the corner of the street,  it #NNS# a view\r\ndown #NNP# Street, with its more #JJ# houses.  Holmes pointed with\r\na chuckle to one of these, a row of #JJ# #NNS#, which #VBN#\r\nso that they could not fail to catch the eye.",
    "\"See, Watson!\" said he.  \"'High red house with stone facings.' There is\r\nthe signal station all right.  We know the place, and we know the code;\r\nso surely our task should be simple.  There's a 'to let' card in that\r\nwindow.  It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has\r\naccess.  Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?\"",
    "\"I have it all ready for you.  If you will both come up and leave your\r\nboots below on the #VBG#, I'll put you there now.\"",
    "It was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged.  The mirror\r\nwas so placed that, seated in the dark, we could very #RB# see the\r\ndoor opposite.  We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left\r\nus, when a distant #NN# #VBD# that our mysterious #NN# had\r\nrung.  #RB# the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon\r\na chair beside the closed door, and then, #VBG# heavily, departed.\r\n#VBG# together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed\r\nupon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady's footsteps died away, there\r\nwas the #NN# of a turning key, the handle #VBD#, and two thin hands\r\ndarted out and lifted the tray from the chair.  An instant later it was\r\nhurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful,\r\nhorrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room.  Then the\r\ndoor #VBD# to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes\r\ntwitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.",
    "\"I will call again in the evening,\" said he to the expectant landlady.\r\n\"I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own\r\nquarters.\"",
    "\"My #VB#, as you saw, proved to be correct,\" said he, speaking from\r\nthe #NNS# of his #NN#.  \"There has been a substitution of\r\nlodgers.  What I did not #VBP# is that we should find a woman, and no\r\nordinary woman, Watson.\"",
    "\"She saw us.\"",
    "\"Well, she saw something to alarm her.  That is certain.  The general\r\nsequence of events is pretty clear, is it not?  A couple seek #NN# in\r\nLondon from a very terrible and instant danger. The #NN# of that\r\ndanger is the #NN# of their precautions. The man, who has some work\r\nwhich he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while\r\nhe does it.  It is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original\r\nfashion, and so #RB# that her presence was not even known to the\r\nlandlady who #NNS# her with food.  The printed messages, as is now\r\nevident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The\r\nman cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her.\r\nSince he cannot communicate with her direct, he has #NN# to the\r\nagony column of a paper.  So far all is clear.\"",
    "\"But what is at the root of it?\"",
    "\"Ah, yes, #RB# practical, as usual!  What is at the root of\r\nit all?  Mrs. Warren's #JJ# problem #VBZ# somewhat and #VBZ#\r\na more sinister aspect as we proceed.  This much we can say:  that it\r\nis no ordinary love #NN#.  You saw the woman's face at the sign of\r\ndanger.  We have heard, too, of the attack upon the #NN#, which was\r\nundoubtedly meant for the lodger.  These #NNS#, and the desperate need\r\nfor secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death.  The attack\r\nupon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are\r\nthemselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the\r\nmale.  It is very curious and complex, Watson.\"",
    "\"Why should you go further in it?  What have you to gain from it?\"",
    "\"What, indeed?  It is #NN# for art's sake, Watson.  I suppose when you\r\n#VBN# you found yourself studying cases without thought of a #NN#?\"",
    "\"For my education, Holmes.\"",
    "\"#NNP# never ends, Watson.  It is a series of #NNS# with the\r\ngreatest for the last.  This is an instructive case.  There is neither\r\nmoney nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to #JJ# it up.  When\r\ndusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our\r\ninvestigation.\"",
    "When we returned to Mrs. Warren's rooms, the #NN# of a London winter\r\nevening had #VBN# into one gray curtain, a dead #JJ# of colour,\r\nbroken only by the sharp yellow #NNS# of the windows and the blurred\r\n#NNS# of the #NN#.  As we #VBD# from the #VBN# sitting-room\r\nof the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the\r\n#NN#.",
    "\"#NN# is moving in that room,\" said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt\r\nand eager face thrust forward to the #NN#.  \"Yes, I can see his\r\nshadow.  #NN#here he is again!  He has a candle in his hand.  Now he is\r\npeering across.  He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout.  Now\r\nhe begins to flash.  Take the message also, Watson, that we may check\r\neach other.  A single #NN# is A, surely.  Now, then.  How many\r\ndid you make it?  #NN#.  So did I.  That should mean T.  #NN#'s\r\nintelligible enough. Another T.  Surely this is the beginning of a\r\nsecond word.  Now, #NN#. Dead #VB#.  That can't be all, Watson?\r\n#NN# gives no sense.  Nor is it any better as three words #IN#, #NN#,\r\n#NNP#, unless T. A. are a person's #NNS#.  There it goes again! What's\r\nthat?  #NN#, it is the same message over again. Curious, Watson,\r\nvery curious.  Now he is off once more!  #NN# he is #VBG# it for\r\nthe third time.  ATTENTA three times!  How often will he repeat it?\r\nNo, that seems to be the #NN#.  He has #VBN# from the window.\r\nWhat do you make of it, Watson?\"",
    "\"A #NN# message, Holmes.\"",
    "My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension.  \"And not a very\r\nobscure #VB#, Watson,\" said he.  \"Why, of course, it is Italian!  The\r\nA means that it is addressed to a woman.  '#VB#! Beware!  Beware!'\r\nHow's that, Watson?",
    "\"I believe you have #VBD# it.\"",
    "\"Not a doubt of it.  It is a very urgent message, #RB# repeated to\r\nmake it more so.  But #VB# of what?  Wait a bit, he is coming to the\r\nwindow once more.\"",
    "Again we saw the dim #NN# of a #VBG# man and the #NN# of the\r\nsmall #NN# across the window as the signals were #VBN#. They came\r\nmore rapidly than #NN# rapid that it was hard to follow them.",
    "\"#NN#, what's that, Watson?  '#NNP#,' isn't it?\r\nYes, by Jove, it's a danger signal.  There he goes again! #NN#.\r\nHalloa, what on #NN#\"",
    "The light had suddenly gone out, the #VBG# square of window had\r\ndisappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the #JJ#\r\nbuilding, with its #NNS# of shining #NN#.  That last warning cry\r\nhad been suddenly cut short.  How, and by whom?  The same thought\r\noccurred on the instant to us both.  Holmes sprang up from where he\r\n#VBD# by the window.",
    "\"This is serious, Watson,\" he cried.  \"There is some devilry going\r\nforward!  Why should such a message stop in such a way?  I should put\r\nScotland Yard in touch with this #NN# yet, it is too pressing\r\nfor us to leave.\"",
    "\"Shall I go for the police?\"",
    "\"We must define the situation a little more clearly.  It may bear some\r\nmore innocent #NN#.  Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves\r\nand see what we can make of it.\"",
    "Two",
    "As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building\r\nwhich we had left.  There, dimly #VBN# at the top window, I could\r\nsee the shadow of a head, a woman's head, gazing #RB#, #RB#, out\r\ninto the night, waiting with #JJ# suspense for the #JJ# of\r\nthat interrupted message.  At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a\r\nman, #JJ# in a cravat and #NN#, was leaning against the\r\nrailing.  He started as the #NN# fell upon our faces.",
    "\"Holmes!\" he cried.",

    "\"#JJ# #NNS#, but leading up to the same tangle.  I've been\r\ntaking the signals.\"",
    "\"Signals?\"",
    "\"Yes, from that window.  They broke off in the middle.  We came over to\r\nsee the reason.  But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in\r\n#VBG# this business.\"",
    "\"Wait a bit!\" cried Gregson eagerly.  \"I'll do you this justice, Mr.\r\nHolmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn't feel stronger for\r\nhaving you on my side.  There's only the one #NN# to these flats, so we\r\nhave him safe.\"",
    "\"Who is he?\"",
    "\"Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes.  You must give us\r\nbest this time.\"  He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which\r\na cabman, his #NN# in his hand, #VBN# over from a #NN#\r\nwhich stood on the far side of the street. \"May I introduce you to Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes?\" he said to the cabman.  \"This is Mr. #NN#, of\r\n#NNP#'s American #NNP#.\"",
    "\"The #NN# of the #NNP# #NNP# #NN# mystery?\" said Holmes.  \"Sir, I am\r\npleased to meet you.\"",

Mr. Gregson and I ran him to\r\nground in that big #NN# house, and there's only one door, so he\r\ncan't #VB# us.  There's three folk come out since he went in, but I'll\r\nswear he wasn't one of them.\"",
    "\"Mr. Holmes talks of signals,\" said Gregson.  \"I expect, as usual, he\r\nknows a good deal that we don't.\"",
    "In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared\r\nto us.  The American struck his hands together with #NN#.",
    "\"He's on to us!\" he cried.",
    "\"Why do you think so?\"",
    "\"Well, it figures out that way, does it not?  Here he is, sending out\r\nmessages to an #NN# are several of his #NN# in London.\r\nThen suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that\r\nthere was danger, he broke short off.  What could it mean except that\r\nfrom the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the\r\nstreet, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and\r\nthat he must act right away if he was to avoid it?  What do you\r\nsuggest, Mr. Holmes?\"",
    "\"That we go up at once and see for ourselves.\"",
    "\"But we have no warrant for his arrest.\"",
    "\"He is in #JJ# premises under suspicious circumstances,\" said\r\nGregson.  \"That is good enough for the moment.  When we have him by the\r\nheels we can see if New York can't help us to keep him.  I'll take the\r\nresponsibility of #VBG# him now.\"",

    "The door of the #JJ# flat upon the third landing was standing\r\najar.  Gregson pushed it open.  #IN# all was absolute silence and\r\ndarkness.  I struck a match and lit the detective's lantern.  As I did\r\nso, and as the flicker #VBD# into a flame, we all #NN# a gasp of\r\nsurprise.  On the deal #NNS# of the #NN# floor there was\r\noutlined a fresh track of blood.  The red steps pointed towards us and\r\nled away from an inner room, the door of which was closed.  Gregson\r\n#VBD# it open and held his light full #NN# in front of him, while we\r\nall #VBN# eagerly over his shoulders.",
    "In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of\r\nan enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face #RB# horrible in\r\nits #NN# and his head #VBD# by a ghastly crimson #NN# of\r\nblood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork.  His #NNS#\r\nwere drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of\r\nhis broad, brown, #JJ# throat there projected the white #NN# of a\r\nknife driven #NN# into his body.  #NNP# as he was, the man must\r\nhave gone down like a #VBN# #NN# before that terrific blow.  Beside\r\nhis right hand a most formidable #VBN#, #JJ# #NN# lay\r\nupon the floor, and near it a black kid #NN#.",
    "\"By George! it's #NNP# Gorgiano himself!\" cried the American detective.\r\n\"Someone has got #RB# of us this time.\"",
    "\"Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,\" said Gregson. \"Why,\r\nwhatever are you doing?\"",
    "Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it\r\nbackward and forward across the window-panes.  Then he peered into the\r\ndarkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.",
    "\"I rather think that will be helpful,\" said he.  He came over and stood\r\nin deep thought while the two #NNS# were examining the body.\r\n\"You say that three people came out from the flat while you were\r\nwaiting downstairs,\" said he at last.  \"Did you observe them closely?\"",
    "\"Yes, I did.\"",
    "\"Was there a fellow about thirty, #JJ#, dark, of middle size?\"",
    "\"Yes; he was the last to pass me.\"",
    "\"That is your man, I fancy.  I can give you his description, and we\r\nhave a very excellent #NN# of his footmark.  That should be enough\r\nfor you.\"",
    "\"Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London.\"",
    "\"Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to #VB# this lady to your\r\naid.\"",
    "We all #VBN# round at the words.  There, framed in the doorway, was a\r\ntall and beautiful #NN# mysterious lodger of #NN#.  Slowly\r\nshe advanced, her face pale and drawn with a #JJ# apprehension,\r\nher eyes fixed and staring, her #VBN# gaze riveted upon the dark\r\nfigure on the floor.",
    "\"You have killed him!\" she muttered.  \"Oh, #NN# #FW#, you have killed\r\nhim!\"  Then I heard a sudden sharp #NN# of her breath, and she sprang\r\ninto the air with a cry of joy.  #NNP# and round the room she danced,\r\nher hands #VBG#, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a\r\nthousand pretty Italian #NNS# #VBG# from her lips.  It was\r\nterrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such\r\na sight.  Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning\r\n#VB#.",
    "\"But you!  You are police, are you not?  You have killed #NNP#\r\nGorgiano.  Is it not so?\"",
    "\"We are police, madam.\"",
    "She looked round into the shadows of the room.",
    "\"But where, then, is #NNP#?\" she asked.  \"He is my husband, Gennaro\r\n#NNP#.  I am #NN# Lucca, and we are both from New York. Where is\r\nGennaro?  He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all\r\nmy #VBN#.\"",
    "\"It was I who called,\" said Holmes.",
    "\"You!  How could you call?\"",
    "\"Your cipher was not difficult, madam.  Your presence here was\r\n#JJ#. I knew that I had only to flash '#NN#' and you would surely\r\ncome.\"",

    "\"I do not understand how you know these things,\" she said. \"Giuseppe\r\n#NN# did #NN#\"  She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up\r\nwith #NN# and delight.  \"Now I see it!  My Gennaro!  My splendid,\r\nbeautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it,\r\nwith his own strong hand he killed the monster!  Oh, Gennaro, how\r\nwonderful you are!  What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?\"",
    "\"Well, Mrs. Lucca,\" said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the\r\nlady's sleeve with as little #NN# as if she were a Notting Hill\r\n#NN#, \"I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but\r\nyou've said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the\r\nYard.\"",
    "\"One moment, Gregson,\" said Holmes.  \"I rather fancy that this lady may\r\nbe as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it.  You\r\nunderstand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the\r\ndeath of the man who lies before us?  What you say may be used in\r\nevidence.  But if you think that he has acted from motives which are\r\nnot criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot\r\nserve him better than by telling us the whole story.\"",
    "\"Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,\" said the lady.  \"He was a\r\ndevil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would\r\npunish my husband for having killed him.\"",
    "\"In that case,\" said Holmes, \"my suggestion is that we lock this door,\r\nleave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form\r\nour opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.\"",
    "Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room\r\nof Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those\r\nsinister events, the ending of which we had #VBD# to witness.  She\r\nspoke in rapid and #JJ# but very unconventional English, which, for\r\nthe sake of #NN#, I will make #JJ#.",
    "\"I was born in #NN#, near #NNP#,\" said she, \"and was the #NN#\r\nof #NNP# #NN#, who was the chief lawyer and once the #NN# of\r\nthat part.

We\r\nfled together, were married at #NNP#, and sold my #NNS# to gain the\r\nmoney which would take us to America.  This was four years ago, and we\r\nhave been in New York ever since.",
    "\"#NNP# was very good to us at first.  Gennaro was able to do a\r\nservice to an Italian #NN# saved him from some #NNS# in the\r\nplace called the #NNP#, and so made a powerful friend.

He took my\r\nhusband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed\r\nhis good-will towards him in every way.  Signor Castalotte was a\r\nbachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and\r\nboth my husband and I loved him as if he were our father.  We had taken\r\nand furnished a little house in #NNP#, and our whole future seemed\r\nassured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to #NN# our\r\nsky.",
    "\"One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a\r\n#NN# back with him.  His name was Gorgiano, and he had\r\ncome also from Posilippo.  He was a huge man, as you can #VB#, for\r\nyou have looked upon his #NN#.  Not only was his body that of a giant\r\nbut everything about him was grotesque, #JJ#, and #JJ#.  His\r\nvoice was like #NN# in our little house.  There was #JJ# room for\r\nthe #NN# of his great arms as he talked.  His thoughts, his emotions,\r\nhis #NNS#, all were exaggerated and monstrous.  He talked, or rather\r\nroared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, #VBN#\r\nwith the #JJ# stream of words.  His eyes #VBD# at you and held you\r\nat his mercy.  He was a terrible and wonderful man.  I thank God that\r\nhe is dead!",
    "\"He came again and again.  Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more\r\nhappy than I was in his presence.  My poor husband would sit pale and\r\n#JJ#, listening to the endless raving upon #NNS# and upon #JJ#\r\nquestions which made up our visitor's conversation.  Gennaro said\r\nnothing, but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some\r\nemotion which I had never seen there before.  At first I thought that\r\nit was dislike.  And then, gradually, I understood that it was more\r\nthan dislike.  It was #NN# deep, secret, #VBG# fear.  That\r\n#NN# night that I read his #NN# put my arms round him and I\r\n#VBN# him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold\r\nnothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man #VBN# him so.",
    "\"He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened.  My poor\r\nGennaro, in his wild and #JJ# days, when all the world seemed against\r\nhim and his mind was driven half mad by the #NNS# of life, had\r\njoined a #NNP# society, the Red Circle, which was #VBN# to the\r\nold #NN#.  The #NNS# and secrets of this #NN# were\r\nfrightful, but once within its rule no #NN# was possible.  When we\r\nhad fled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off\r\nforever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the\r\nvery man who had #VBN# him in Naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who\r\nhad #VBD# the name of '#NN#' in the south of #RB#, for he was red to\r\nthe elbow in murder!  He had come to New York to avoid the Italian\r\npolice, and he had already #VBN# a branch of this dreadful society in\r\nhis new home.  All this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which\r\nhe had received that very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it\r\ntelling him that a #NN# would be held upon a certain date, and that\r\nhis presence at it was #VBN# and ordered.",
    "\"That was bad enough, but worse was to come.  I had noticed for some\r\ntime that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the\r\nevening, he spoke much to me; and even when his words were to my\r\nhusband those terrible, glaring, #NN# eyes of his were always\r\nturned upon me.  One night his secret came out.  I had #VBN# what he\r\ncalled 'love' within #NN# love of a #NN# savage.  Gennaro had\r\nnot yet returned when he came.  He pushed his way in, #VBN# me in his\r\nmighty arms, #VBD# me in his bear's #VB#, covered me with #NNS#,\r\nand implored me to come away with him.  I was #VBG# and screaming\r\nwhen Gennaro entered and attacked him.  He struck Gennaro senseless and\r\nfled from the house which he was never more to enter.  It was a deadly\r\nenemy that we made that night.",
    "\"A few days later came the meeting.  Gennaro returned from it with a\r\nface which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse\r\nthan we could have imagined possible.  The #NNS# of the society were\r\nraised by #VBG# rich #NNPS# and threatening them with violence\r\nshould they #VB# the money. It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend\r\nand #NN#, had been approached.  He had refused to #VB# to\r\nthreats, and he had handed the #NNS# to the police.  It was #VBN#\r\nnow that such an example should be made of them as would prevent any\r\nother victim from #VBG#. At the meeting it was arranged that he and\r\nhis house should be #VBN# up with #NN#.  There was a drawing of\r\n#NNS# as to who should carry out the deed.  Gennaro saw our enemy's\r\ncruel face smiling at him as he #VBD# his hand in the bag. No doubt it\r\nhad been prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with\r\nthe Red Circle upon it, the #NN# for murder, which lay upon his\r\n#NN#.  He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and\r\nme to the vengeance of his #NNS#.  It was part of their fiendish\r\nsystem to punish those whom they feared or hated by #VBG# not only\r\ntheir own persons but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge\r\nof this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro's head and drove\r\nhim nearly crazy with apprehension.",
    "\"All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each\r\n#VBG# each for the #NNS# that lay before us.  The very next\r\nevening had been fixed for the attempt.  By midday my husband and I\r\nwere on our way to London, but not before he had given our benefactor\r\nfull warning of this danger, and had also left such information for the\r\npolice as would #VB# his life for the future.",
    "\"The rest, gentlemen, you know for #PRP#.  We were sure that our\r\nenemies would be behind us like our own shadows.  Gorgiano had his\r\nprivate reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how #JJ#,\r\ncunning, and #VBG# he could be.  #DT# Italy and America are full of\r\nstories of his dreadful powers.  If ever they were #VBN# it would be\r\nnow.  My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had\r\ngiven us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no\r\npossible danger could reach me. For his own part, he wished to be free\r\nthat he might communicate both with the American and with the Italian\r\npolice.  I do not myself know where he lived, or how.  All that I\r\nlearned was through the columns of a newspaper.  But once as I looked\r\nthrough my window, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I\r\nunderstood that in some way Gorgiano had found our retreat. Finally\r\nGennaro told me, through the paper, that he would signal to me from a\r\ncertain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but\r\n#NNS#, which were suddenly interrupted.  It is very clear to me now\r\nthat he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was\r\nready for him when he came.  And now, gentleman, I would ask you\r\nwhether we have anything to fear from the law, or whether any judge\r\nupon earth would #VB# my Gennaro for what he has done?\"",
    "\"Well, Mr. Gregson,\" said the American, looking across at the official,\r\n\"I don't know what your British point of view may be, but I guess that\r\nin New York this lady's husband will receive a pretty general #NN# of\r\nthanks.\"",
    "\"She will have to come with me and see the chief,\" Gregson answered.\r\n\"If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband\r\nhas much to fear.  But what I can't make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes,\r\nis how on earth YOU got yourself mixed up in the matter.\"",

    "\"Nothing of the sort,\" said the Professor, severely.  \"#VBG#, as I do,\r\nin an #VBN# and scientific atmosphere, I could not have conceived\r\nthat the first #NNS# of zoology were so little known.

You are a #NNP# of science who has\r\ndiscovered a #NN# world.  I'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you.\r\nIt was all so unthinkable.

The pyramidal rock upon which I saw and shot the\r\npterodactyl was more accessible.  #VBG# something of a #NN#, I did\r\n#VB# to get half way to the top of that.  From that height I had a\r\nbetter idea of the #NN# upon the top of the #NNS#.  It appeared to\r\nbe very large; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the\r\n#NN# of #VBN# cliffs.

    "\"No, sir, I did not; but during the week that we lay #VBN# at the\r\n#NN# of the cliff we heard some very strange #NNS# from above.\"",
    "\"But the creature that the American drew?  How do you account for that?\"",
    "\"We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and\r\nseen it there.  We know, therefore, that there is a way up.  We know\r\nequally that it must be a very difficult one, otherwise the creatures\r\nwould have come down and overrun the #VBG# country.  Surely that\r\nis clear?\"",
    "\"But how did they come to be there?\"",
    "\"I do not think that the problem is a very obscure one,\" said the\r\nProfessor; \"there can only be one explanation.  South America is, as\r\nyou may have heard, a #NN# #NN#.  At this single point in the\r\n#JJ# there has be#IN#, in some far distant age, a great, sudden\r\n#JJ# upheaval.  These cliffs, I may remark, are basaltic, and\r\ntherefore #NN#.  An area, as large perhaps as #NNP#, has been\r\nlifted up en #NN# with all its living contents, and cut off by\r\n#JJ# #NNS# of a hardness which #VBZ# #NN# from all\r\nthe rest of the continent.  What is the result?  Why, the ordinary laws\r\nof Nature are #VBN#.  The various #NNS# which #NN# the\r\nstruggle for existence in the world at large are all #VBN# or\r\n#VBN#.  #NNS# survive which would otherwise disappear.  You will\r\nobserve that both the pterodactyl and the #NN# are Jurassic, and\r\ntherefore of a great age in the order of life.  They have been\r\n#RB# #VBN# by those strange #JJ# conditions.\"",
    "\"But surely your evidence is conclusive.  You have only to lay it\r\nbefore the proper #NNS#.\"",
    "\"So in my simplicity, I had imagined,\" said the Professor, bitterly.\r\n\"I can only tell you that it was not so, that I was met at every turn\r\nby incredulity, born partly of #NN# and partly of #NN#.  It is\r\nnot my nature, sir, to #VBP# to any man, or to seek to prove a fact if\r\nmy word has been #VBD#.  After the first I have not #VBN# to\r\nshow such #NN# proofs as I possess.  The subject became\r\n#JJ# to me--I would not speak of it.

    "Tarp Henry looked thoughtful.",
    "\"He is not a popular person, the genial Challenger,\" said he.  \"A lot\r\nof people have accounts to settle with him.  I should say he is about\r\nthe #VBN# man in London.  If the medical students turn out there\r\nwill be no end of a rag.  I don't want to get into a #NN#.\"",
    "\"You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.\"",
    "\"Well, perhaps it's only fair.  All right.  I'm your man for the\r\nevening.\"",
    "When we arrived at the hall we found a much greater #NN# than I\r\nhad expected.  A line of electric #NNS# discharged their little\r\n#NNS# of #JJ# #NNS#, while the dark stream of #NN#\r\n#NNS#, who #VBN# through the #JJ# #NN#, showed that the\r\naudience would be popular as well as scientific.  Indeed, it became\r\nevident to us as soon as we had taken our seats that a youthful and\r\neven boyish spirit was abroad in the #NN# and the back #NNS# of\r\nthe hall.  Looking behind me, I could see rows of faces of the familiar\r\nmedical student type.  Apparently the great hospitals had each #NN#\r\ndown their #JJ#.  The behavior of the audience at present was\r\n#JJ#, but mischievous.  #NNS# of popular songs were #VBD#\r\nwith an enthusiasm which was a strange #NN# to a scientific lecture,\r\nand there was already a #NN# to personal #NN# which #VBD# a\r\n#JJ# evening to others, however #JJ# it might be to the\r\n#NNS# of these dubious #NNS#.",
    "Thus, when old #NNP# #NN#, with his well-known #VBN#\r\n#NN#, appeared upon the platform, there was such a universal #NN#\r\nof \"Where #VBD# you get that #NN#?\" that he hurriedly removed it, and\r\nconcealed it #RB# under his chair.  When #JJ# Professor Wadley\r\n#VBD# down to his seat there were general #JJ# inquiries from\r\nall parts of the hall as to the exact state of his poor #NN#, which\r\ncaused him obvious #NN#.  The greatest demonstration of all,\r\nhowever, was at the #NN# of my new acquaintance, Professor\r\nChallenger, when he passed down to take his place at the extreme end of\r\nthe front row of the platform.  Such a yell of welcome broke forth when\r\nhis black beard first protruded round the corner that I began to\r\nsuspect Tarp Henry was right in his surmise, and that this #NN#\r\nwas there not merely for the sake of the lecture, but because it had\r\ngot #VBN# abroad that the famous Professor would take part in the\r\nproceedings.",
    "There was some #JJ# laughter on his entrance among the front\r\n#NNS# of #JJ# #NNS#, as though the demonstration of the\r\nstudents in this #NN# was not #JJ# to them.  That #VBG#\r\nwas, indeed, a frightful outburst of sound, the #NN# of the #NN#\r\ncage when the step of the #VBG# #NN# is heard in the\r\ndistance.  There was an offensive tone in it, perhaps, and yet in the\r\nmain it struck me as mere #JJ# #NN#, the noisy reception of one\r\nwho amused and interested them, rather than of one they disliked or\r\ndespised.  Challenger smiled with weary and tolerant contempt, as a\r\nkindly man would meet the #VBG# of a litter of #NNS#.  He sat\r\nslowly down, blew out his chest, passed his hand #RB# down his\r\nbeard, and looked with drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes at the\r\ncrowded hall before him.  The uproar of his advent had not yet died\r\naway when Professor #NNP# #NNP#, the #NN#, and Mr. Waldron, the\r\nlecturer, #VBN# their way to the front, and the proceedings began.",
    "Professor Murray will, I am sure, excuse me if I say that he has the\r\ncommon fault of most #NNS# of being inaudible.  Why on earth\r\npeople who have something to say which is worth hearing should not take\r\nthe slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange\r\n#NNS# of modern life.  Their methods are as reasonable as to try to\r\npour some precious stuff from the spring to the #NN# through a\r\n#VBG# pipe, which could by the least effort be opened.\r\nProfessor Murray made several profound remarks to his white #NN# and to\r\nthe #NN# upon the table, with a humorous, #VBG# aside to\r\nthe silver #NN# upon his right.  Then he sat down, and Mr.\r\nWaldron, the famous popular lecturer, rose amid a general murmur of\r\napplause.  He was a stern, gaunt man, with a harsh voice, and an\r\naggressive manner, but he had the merit of knowing how to #VB#\r\nthe #NNS# of other men, and to pass them on in a way which was\r\nintelligible and even interesting to the #NN# public, with a happy #NN#\r\nof being #JJ# about the most unlikely #NNS#, so that the #NN#\r\nof the #NNP# or the formation of a #JJ# became a highly\r\nhumorous process as treated by him.",
    "It was a bird'#NN# view of #NN#, as #VBN# by science, which,\r\nin language always clear and sometimes #JJ#, he #VBD# before\r\nus.  He told us of the #NN#, a huge mass of #JJ# gas, flaring\r\nthrough the heavens.  Then he #VBN# the #NN#, the #VBG#,\r\nthe #VBG# which formed the #NNS#, the #NN# which turned to\r\nwater, the slow preparation of the stage upon which was to be played\r\nthe inexplicable drama of life.  On the #NN# of life itself he was\r\ndiscreetly vague.  That the #NNS# of it could hardly have #VBD# the\r\noriginal #VBG# was, he declared, fairly certain.  Therefore it had\r\ncome later.  Had it built itself out of the cooling, #JJ# elements\r\nof the globe?  Very likely.  Had the germs of it arrived from outside\r\nupon a #NN#?  It was hardly conceivable.  On the whole, the #JJS#\r\nman was the least dogmatic upon the point.  We could #NN# at least\r\nwe had not succeeded up to date in making #JJ# life in our\r\n#NNS# out of inorganic materials.  The #NN# between the dead and\r\nthe living was something which our #NN# could not as yet bridge.\r\nBut there was a higher and #JJR# chemistry of Nature, which, working\r\nwith great forces over long #NNS#, might well produce results which\r\nwere impossible for us.  There the matter must be left.",
    "This brought the lecturer to the great #NN# of animal life, beginning\r\nlow down in #NN# and feeble sea creatures, then up rung by rung\r\nthrough #NNS# and #NNS#, till at last we came to a #NN#, a\r\ncreature which brought forth its young alive, the direct #NN# of\r\nall #NNS#, and presumably, therefore, of everyone in the audience.\r\n(\"No, no,\" from a sceptical student in the back row.)  If the young\r\ngentleman in the red tie who cried \"No, no,\" and who presumably #VBD#\r\nto have been #VBN# out of an egg, would wait upon him after the\r\nlecture, he would be glad to see such a curiosity.  (#NN#.)  It was\r\nstrange to think that the #NN# of all the #NN# process of Nature\r\nhad been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie.  But had the\r\nprocess stopped?

He hoped that he would not hurt the\r\nfeelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he #VBN# that,\r\nwhatever #NNS# that gentleman might possess in private life, still\r\nthe vast #NNS# of the universe were not fully justified if they\r\nwere to end entirely in his #NN#.

    "#VBG# thus, amid a general #NN#, played very #RB# with his\r\n#NN#, the lecturer went back to his picture of the past, the\r\n#VBG# of the #NNS#, the #NN# of the #NN#, the #JJ#,\r\n#JJ# life which lay upon their #NNS#, the #JJ# #NNS#, the\r\ntendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the #NNS#, the\r\n#NN# of food awaiting them, their #JJ# enormous #NN#.\r\n\"Hence, ladies and gentlemen,\" he added, \"that frightful #NN# of\r\nsaurians which still #NN# our eyes when seen in the #NN# or in\r\nthe #NN# #NN#, but which were fortunately #JJ# long before\r\nthe first appearance of #NN# upon this planet.\"",

    "Waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the\r\nplatform until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger, who leaned\r\nback in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression, as if he\r\nwere smiling in his sleep.",
    "\"I see!\" said Waldron, with a #NN#.  \"It is my friend Professor\r\nChallenger,\" and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a\r\nfinal explanation and no more need be said.",
    "But the incident was far from being closed.  #WDT# path the lecturer\r\ntook amid the #NNS# of the past seemed #RB# to lead him to some\r\nassertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly brought the\r\nsame #NNS#' bellow from the Professor.  The audience began to\r\n#VB# it and to roar with delight when it came.

Waldron, though a hardened\r\nlecturer and a strong man, became #VBN#.  He hesitated, stammered,\r\nrepeated himself, got #VBD# in a long sentence, and finally turned\r\n#RB# upon the cause of his troubles.",
    "\"This is really intolerable!\" he cried, glaring across the platform.\r\n\"I must ask you, Professor Challenger, to cease these ignorant and\r\n#RB# #NNS#.\"",

    "At last the lecture came to an #NN# am inclined to think that it was\r\na premature one, as the #NN# was hurried and #VBN#.  The\r\nthread of the argument had been #RB# broken, and the audience was\r\nrestless and expectant.

    "\"#NNP# and #NNS#,\" he began, amid a #VBN# interruption from\r\nthe back.  \"I beg #NNS#, Gentlemen, and #NN# must\r\napologize, I had #RB# #VBN# a considerable #NN# of this\r\naudience\" (#NN#, during which the Professor stood with one hand\r\nraised and his enormous head #VBG# #RB#, as if he were\r\n#VBG# a #JJ# #VBG# upon the crowd), \"I have been #VBN#\r\nto move a vote of thanks to Mr. Waldron for the very picturesque and\r\n#JJ# address to which we have just listened.

It is upon the #NN# of\r\ncertain #NNS# of animal life upon the earth.  I do not speak upon this\r\nsubject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I\r\nspeak as one whose scientific conscience #VBZ# him to #VB# closely\r\nto facts, when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in #VBG# that\r\nbecause he has never himself seen a #JJ# prehistoric animal,\r\ntherefore these creatures no longer #VB#.

    "All this is from my #VBN# notes taken at the time, which give little\r\n#NN# of the absolute #NNS# to which the #RB# had by this time\r\nbeen reduced.  So terrific was the uproar that several ladies had\r\nalready #VBN# a hurried retreat.  #JJ# and #NN# #NNS# seemed to\r\nhave caught the #VBG# spirit as badly as the students, and I saw\r\nwhite-bearded men rising and shaking their fists at the #JJ#\r\nProfessor.  The whole great audience #VBN# and #VBN# like a\r\n#VBG# #NN#.  The Professor took a step forward and raised both his\r\nhands.  There was something so big and arresting and #JJ# in the man\r\nthat the clatter and shouting died gradually away before his #VBG#\r\ngesture and his masterful eyes.  He seemed to have a definite message.\r\nThey #JJ# to hear it.",
    "\"I will not #VB# you,\" he said.  \"It is not worth it.  #NN# is\r\ntruth, and the #NN# of a number of foolish young #NN#, I fear I\r\nmust add, of their equally foolish #NN# affect the matter.\r\nI claim that I have opened a new field of science.

    "Mr. #NN#, the #NN# Professor of Comparative #NN#, rose among\r\nthe audience, a tall, thin, bitter man, with the withered aspect of a\r\n#NN#.  He wished, he said, to ask Professor Challenger whether\r\nthe results to which he had alluded in his remarks had been obtained\r\nduring a journey to the #NNS# of the Amazon made by him two years\r\nbefore.",
    "Professor Challenger answered that they had.",
    "Mr. Summerlee desired to know how it was that Professor Challenger\r\nclaimed to have made discoveries in those #NNS# which had been\r\noverlooked by Wallace, Bates, and other previous #NNS# of\r\nestablished scientific repute.",
    "Professor Challenger answered that Mr. Summerlee appeared to be\r\n#JJ# the Amazon with the Thames; that it was in reality a somewhat\r\nlarger river; that Mr. Summerlee might be interested to know that with\r\nthe #NNP#, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of\r\ncountry were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not\r\nimpossible for one person to find what another had missed.",
    "Mr. Summerlee declared, with an acid smile, that he fully #VBN#\r\nthe difference between the Thames and the Amazon, which lay in the fact\r\nthat any assertion about the former could be tested, while about the\r\nlatter it could not.  He would be obliged if Professor Challenger would\r\ngive the #NN# and the #NN# of the country in which prehistoric\r\nanimals were to be found.",
    "Professor Challenger #VBD# that he reserved such information for good\r\nreasons of his own, but would be prepared to give it with proper\r\nprecautions to a #NN# chosen from the audience.  Would #VB#.\r\nSummerlee serve on such a committee and test his story in person?",
    "Mr. Summerlee:  \"Yes, I will.\"  (Great cheering.)",
    "Professor Challenger:  \"Then I #NN# that I will place in your\r\nhands such material as will enable you to find your way.  It is only\r\nright, however, since Mr. Summerlee goes to check my statement that I\r\nshould have one or more with him who may check his.  I will not\r\n#VB# from you that there are difficulties and dangers.  Mr.\r\nSummerlee will need a younger #NN#.  May I ask for #NNS#?\"",
    "It is thus that the great crisis of a man's life #NNS# out at him.\r\nCould I have imagined when I entered that hall that I was about to\r\npledge myself to a #NN# adventure than had ever come to me in my\r\ndreams?  But #NN# it not the very opportunity of which she\r\nspoke?  Gladys would have told me to go.  I had sprung to my feet.  I\r\nwas speaking, and yet I had prepared no words.  Tarp Henry, my\r\ncompanion, was #VBG# at my #NNS# and I heard him #VBG#, \"Sit\r\ndown, Malone! Don't make a public ass of yourself.\"  At the same time I\r\nwas aware that a tall, thin man, with dark gingery hair, a few seats in\r\nfront of me, was also upon his feet.  He glared back at me with hard\r\nangry eyes, but I refused to give way.",
    "\"I will go, Mr. Chairman,\" I kept repeating over and over again.",
    "\"#NN#!  Name!\" cried the audience.",
    "\"My name is Edward #NNP# Malone.  I am the #NN# of the Daily\r\nGazette.  I claim to be an absolutely #VBN# witness.\"",
    "\"What is YOUR name, sir?\" the chairman asked of my tall rival.",

    "\"Lord John Roxton's reputation as a sportsman and a traveler is, of\r\ncourse, #JJ#,\" said the chairman; \"at the same time it would\r\ncertainly be as well to have a member of the #NNP# upon such an\r\nexpedition.\"",
    "\"Then I move,\" said Professor Challenger, \"that both these gentlemen be\r\n#VBN#, as representatives of this meeting, to #VB# Professor\r\nSummerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth\r\nof my #NNS#.\"",
    "And so, amid shouting and cheering, our fate was decided, and I found\r\nmyself #VBN# away in the human #JJ# which swirled towards the door,\r\nwith my mind half #VBD# by the vast new #NN# which had risen so\r\nsuddenly before it.  As I emerged from the hall I was conscious for a\r\nmoment of a rush of laughing #NN# the #NN#, and of an arm\r\n#VBG# a heavy #NN#, which rose and fell in the midst of them.\r\nThen, amid a mixture of groans and cheers, Professor Challenger's\r\nelectric #NN# slid from the curb, and I found myself walking under\r\nthe #JJ# lights of #NNP# Street, full of thoughts of Gladys and of\r\nwonder as to my future.",
    "Suddenly there was a touch at my elbow.  I turned, and found myself\r\nlooking into the humorous, masterful eyes of the tall, thin man who had\r\n#VBD# to be my companion on this strange quest.",
    "\"Mr. Malone, I understand,\" said he.  \"We are to be #NN#?\r\nMy rooms are just over the road, in the #NNP#.  Perhaps you would have\r\nthe kindness to spare me half an hour, for there are one or two things\r\nthat I badly want to say to you.\"",
    "                            CHAPTER VI",
    "                  \"I was the #NN# of the Lord\"",
    "Lord John Roxton and I turned down #NN# Street together and through the\r\n#JJ# #NNS# of the famous #JJ# #NN#.  At the end of a long\r\ndrab passage my new acquaintance pushed open a door and turned on an\r\nelectric switch.  A number of lamps shining through tinted #NNS#\r\n#VBN# the whole great room before us in a ruddy radiance.  Standing in\r\nthe doorway and glancing round me, I had a general impression of\r\nextraordinary comfort and #NN# combined with an atmosphere of\r\n#JJ# #NN#.  #RB# there were #VBD# the #NN# of the\r\n#JJ# man of taste and the #JJ# untidiness of the bachelor.  #NNP#\r\n#NNS# and strange #JJ# #NNS# from some #JJ# #NN# were\r\nscattered upon the floor.  #NNPS# and prints which even my\r\n#VBN# eyes could recognize as being of great price and #NN#\r\nhung thick upon the walls.  #NNS# of #NNS#, of #NNS#, and of\r\n#NNS# #VBD# with a #JJ# #NNP#, a #JJ# #NN#,\r\nand a #JJ# #NNP#.  But amid these varied #NNS# there were\r\nscattered the #NNS# which brought back strongly to my recollection\r\nthe fact that Lord John Roxton was one of the great #JJ# #NNS#\r\nand #NNS# of his day.  A #JJ# oar crossed with a #NN#\r\none above his #NN# spoke of the old #NN# and #NN# man,\r\nwhile the #NNS# and #NNS# above and below them were the tools\r\nof a man who had won #NN# with each.  Like a #NN# round the room\r\nwas the #VBG# line of splendid heavy #NNS#, the best of their\r\nsort from every quarter of the world, with the rare white #NNS# of\r\nthe #NN# #NN# drooping its supercilious #NN# above them all.",
    "In the center of the rich red #NN# was a black and gold Louis #NN#\r\ntable, a #RB# #JJ#, now #RB# #VBN# with marks of\r\nglasses and the #NNS# of #NN#.  On it stood a silver tray of\r\n#NN# and a #VBN# #NN#, from which and an #JJ#\r\n#VB# my silent host proceeded to charge two high glasses.  Having\r\nindicated an arm-chair to me and placed my #NN# near it, he\r\nhanded me a long, #JJ# #NNP#.  Then, #VBG# himself opposite to me,\r\nhe looked at me long and #RB# with his strange, twinkling, #JJ#\r\n#NN# of a cold light blue, the color of a #NN# #NN#.",
    "Through the thin haze of my #NN# I noted the details of a face\r\nwhich was already familiar to me from many #NN#\r\n#VBN# nose, the hollow, worn cheeks, the dark, ruddy hair,\r\nthin at the top, the #JJ#, virile #NN#, the small, aggressive\r\ntuft upon his projecting chin.  Something there was of #NNP# III.,\r\nsomething of Don #NNP#, and yet again something which was the #NN#\r\nof the English country gentleman, the keen, alert, open-air lover of\r\n#NNS# and of horses.  His skin was of a rich #NN# red from sun and\r\nwind.  His eyebrows were tufted and #VBG#, which gave those\r\nnaturally cold eyes an almost #JJ# aspect, an impression which was\r\nincreased by his strong and #JJ# brow.  In figure he was spare, but\r\nvery strongly #VBN#, he had often proved that there were few\r\nmen in England capable of such sustained #NNS#.  His height was a\r\nlittle over six feet, but he seemed #JJR# on account of a peculiar\r\n#VBG# of the shoulders.  Such was the famous Lord John Roxton as he\r\nsat opposite to me, biting hard upon his cigar and watching me steadily\r\nin a long and embarrassing silence.",
    "\"Well,\" said he, at last, \"we've gone and done it, young #NN# my\r\n#NN#.\"  (This curious phrase he pronounced as if it were all one\r\n#NN#\"#NN#.\")  \"Yes, we've taken a jump, you an' me.  I\r\nsuppose, now, when you went into that room there was no such notion in\r\nyour #NN#?\"",

    "\"No.\"",
    "\"Why, young fellah, where HAVE you lived?  Sir John #NNP# is the\r\nbest gentleman #NN# in the north country.  I could hold him on the flat\r\nat my best, but over #NNS# he's my master.

    "It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into one's day's\r\nwork.  I don't think that I am a particularly brave man.

I dare say that I could\r\nthrow myself over a #NN#, like the #NNP# in the history books, if my\r\ncourage to do it were #VBD#, and yet it would surely be pride and\r\nfear, rather than courage, which would be my inspiration.  Therefore,\r\nalthough every nerve in my body #VBD# from the #VBN# figure\r\nwhich I pictured in the room above, I still answered, in as careless a\r\nvoice as I could #NN#, that I was ready to go.

I left\r\nhim seated amid his pink radiance, #VBG# the lock of his favorite\r\nrifle, while he still chuckled to himself at the thought of the\r\nadventures which awaited us.  It was very clear to me that if dangers\r\nlay before us I could not in all England have found a cooler head or a\r\n#JJR# spirit with which to share them.",
    "That night, #VBD# as I was after the wonderful happenings of the day,\r\nI sat late with McArdle, the news editor, explaining to him the whole\r\nsituation, which he thought important enough to bring next morning\r\nbefore the notice of Sir George Beaumont, the chief.  It was agreed\r\nthat I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of\r\nsuccessive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be #VBN#\r\nfor the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later,\r\naccording to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet\r\nknow what conditions he might attach to those directions which should\r\nguide us to the unknown land.  In response to a #NN# inquiry, we\r\nreceived nothing more definite than a #NN# against the Press,\r\nending up with the remark that if we would #VB# our boat he would\r\n#VB# us any directions which he might think it proper to give us at the\r\nmoment of starting.  A second question from us failed to #VB# any\r\nanswer at all, save a #JJ# bleat from his wife to the effect that\r\nher husband was in a very violent temper already, and that she hoped we\r\nwould do nothing to make it worse.  A third attempt, later in the day,\r\n#VBD# a terrific crash, and a #JJ# message from the Central\r\nExchange that Professor Challenger's #NN# had been #VBN#.\r\nAfter that we abandoned all attempt at #NN#.",
    "And now my patient readers, I can address you #RB# no longer.  From\r\nnow #RB# (if, indeed, any #NN# of this narrative should ever\r\nreach you) it can only be through the paper which I represent.  In the\r\nhands of the editor I leave this account of the events which have led\r\nup to one of the most remarkable #NNS# of all time, so that if I\r\nnever return to England there shall be some record as to how the affair\r\ncame about.  I am writing these last lines in the #NN# of the Booth\r\n#NN# #NN#, and they will go back by the pilot to the keeping of\r\nMr. McArdle.  Let me draw one last picture before I close the\r\n#NN# picture which is the last memory of the old country which I\r\nbear away with me.  It is a wet, foggy morning in the late spring; a\r\nthin, cold rain is #VBG#.  Three shining #VBN# figures are\r\nwalking down the #NN#, making for the #NN# of the great liner\r\nfrom which the #NN# is flying.  In front of them a #NN# #VBZ#\r\na #NN# piled high with #NNS#, #VBZ#, and #NN#.  Professor\r\nSummerlee, a long, melancholy figure, walks with dragging steps and\r\ndrooping head, as one who is already #RB# sorry for himself.\r\nLord John Roxton steps briskly, and his thin, eager face #NNS# forth\r\nbetween his #NN# and his #NN#.  As for myself, I am glad to\r\nhave got the #JJ# days of preparation and the #NNS# of #VBG#\r\nbehind me, and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing.  Suddenly,\r\njust as we reach the #NN#, there is a #NN# behind us.  It is\r\nProfessor Challenger, who had promised to see us off.  He runs after\r\nus, a puffing, red-faced, #NN# figure.",
    "\"No #NN# you,\" says he; \"I should much prefer not to go aboard.  I\r\nhave only a few words to say to you, and they can very well be said\r\nwhere we are.  I beg you not to imagine that I am in any way #JJ#\r\nto you for making this journey.  I would have you to understand that it\r\nis a matter of perfect #NN# to me, and I refuse to #VB#\r\nthe most #JJ# sense of personal #NN#.  Truth is truth, and\r\nnothing which you can report can affect it in any way, though it may\r\nexcite the emotions and #VB# the curiosity of a number of very\r\n#JJ# people.  My directions for your #NN# and guidance\r\nare in this sealed envelope.  You will open it when you reach a town\r\nupon the Amazon which is called #NNS#, but not until the date and hour\r\nwhich is marked upon the outside.  Have I made myself clear?  I leave\r\nthe strict #NN# of my conditions entirely to your honor.  No, Mr.\r\nMalone, I will place no #NN# upon your correspondence, since the\r\n#NN# of the facts is the object of your journey; but I #NN#\r\nthat you shall give no #NNS# as to your exact #NN#, and\r\nthat nothing be actually published until your return.  Good-bye, sir.\r\nYou have done something to #VB# my feelings for the #JJ#\r\nprofession to which you #RB# belong.  Good-bye, Lord John.\r\n#NNP# is, as I understand, a sealed book to you; but you may\r\ncongratulate yourself upon the #NN# which awaits you.  You\r\nwill, no doubt, have the opportunity of describing in the #NNP# how you\r\nbrought down the #VBG# dimorphodon.  And good-bye to you also,\r\nProfessor Summerlee.  If you are still capable of #NN#, of\r\nwhich I am #RB# unconvinced, you will surely return to London a\r\nwiser man.\"",
    "So he turned upon his #NN#, and a minute later from the #NN# I could\r\nsee his short, #JJ# figure #VBG# about in the distance as he made\r\nhis way back to his train.  Well, we are well down Channel now.\r\nThere's the last bell for letters, and it's good-bye to the pilot.\r\nWe'll be \"down, #NN#, on the old trail\" from now on.

    "            \"To-morrow we #VB# into the #JJ#\"",
    "I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of\r\nour luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our\r\nweek's stay at Para (save that I should wish to #VBP# the great\r\nkindness of the #NNP# #NNP# #NN# Company in helping us to get together\r\nour equipment).  I will also #NN# very briefly to our river journey,\r\nup a wide, #JJ#, #VBN# stream, in a steamer which was\r\nlittle smaller than that which had carried us across the #NNP#.\r\n#RB# we found ourselves through the #VBZ# of #NNS# and reached\r\nthe town of Manaos.  Here we were rescued from the limited #NNS#\r\nof the local #NN# by Mr. #NN#, the representative of the British and\r\nBrazilian #VBG# Company.  In his #JJ# #NN# we spent our time\r\nuntil the day when we were #VBN# to open the letter of instructions\r\ngiven to us by Professor Challenger.  Before I reach the surprising\r\nevents of that date I would desire to give a clearer sketch of my\r\ncomrades in this enterprise, and of the #NNS# whom we had already\r\ngathered together in South America.  I speak #RB#, and I leave the\r\nuse of my material to your own discretion, Mr. McArdle, since it is\r\nthrough your hands that this report must pass before it reaches the\r\nworld.",
    "The scientific #NNS# of Professor Summerlee are too well known\r\nfor me to trouble to #VB# them.  He is better #VBN# for a\r\nrough expedition of this sort than one would imagine at first sight.\r\nHis tall, gaunt, #JJ# figure is insensible to #NN#, and his dry,\r\n#NN#, and often #RB# #JJ# manner is #VBN#\r\nby any change in his surroundings.  Though in his #NN# year, I\r\nhave never heard him express any #NN# at the occasional\r\n#NNS# which we have had to #NN#.  I had regarded his presence\r\nas an #NN# to the expedition, but, as a matter of fact, I am now\r\nwell convinced that his power of endurance is as great as my own.  In\r\ntemper he is naturally acid and sceptical.  From the beginning he has\r\nnever concealed his belief that Professor Challenger is an absolute\r\nfraud, that we are all #VBN# upon an absurd #NN# #NN# and\r\nthat we are likely to #VB# nothing but disappointment and danger in\r\nSouth America, and #JJ# #NN# in England.  Such are the\r\nviews which, with much passionate distortion of his thin features and\r\n#VBG# of his thin, #NN# beard, he #VBD# into our ears all the\r\nway from #NNP# to Manaos.  Since landing from the boat he has\r\nobtained some #NN# from the beauty and #NN# of the #NN# and\r\nbird life around him, for he is absolutely whole-hearted in his\r\n#NN# to science.  He #VBZ# his days #VBG# through the woods\r\nwith his #NN# and his #NN#, and his #NNS# in #VBG#\r\nthe many #NNS# he has #VBN#.  Among his #JJ# peculiarities are\r\nthat he is careless as to his attire, unclean in his person,\r\nexceedingly #JJ# in his habits, and #VBN# to smoking a\r\nshort #NN# pipe, which is seldom out of his mouth.  He has been upon\r\nseveral scientific expeditions in his youth (he was with #NNP# in\r\n#NNP#), and the life of the camp and the #NN# is nothing fresh to him.",
    "Lord John Roxton has some points in common with Professor Summerlee,\r\nand others in which they are the very #NN# to each other.  He is\r\ntwenty years younger, but has something of the same spare, #NN#\r\n#NN#.  As to his appearance, I have, as I recollect, described it\r\nin that portion of my narrative which I have left behind me in London.\r\nHe is exceedingly neat and prim in his ways, #NNS# always with great\r\ncare in white #NN# #NNS# and high brown #NN#, and #VBZ# at\r\nleast once a day.  Like most men of action, he is laconic in speech,\r\nand #VBZ# readily into his own thoughts, but he is always quick to\r\nanswer a question or join in a conversation, talking in a queer, #JJ#,\r\nhalf-humorous fashion.  His knowledge of the world, and very especially\r\nof South America, is surprising, and he has a whole-hearted belief in\r\nthe possibilities of our journey which is not to be dashed by the\r\n#VBZ# of Professor Summerlee.  He has a gentle voice and a quiet\r\nmanner, but behind his twinkling blue eyes there #VBZ# a capacity for\r\nfurious #NN# and #JJ# #NN#, the more dangerous because\r\nthey are held in leash.  He spoke little of his own exploits in #NNP#\r\nand #NNP#, but it was a revelation to me to find the excitement which\r\nwas caused by his presence among the riverine natives, who looked upon\r\nhim as their champion and #NN#.  The exploits of the Red #NNP#, as\r\nthey called him, had become legends among them, but the real facts, as\r\nfar as I could learn them, were amazing enough.",
    "These were that Lord John had found himself some years before in that\r\n#JJ#'#NN# which is formed by the #VBN# #NNS# between\r\nPeru, Brazil, and #NNP#.  In this great district the wild #NN#\r\ntree #NNS#, and has become, as in the #NNP#, a curse to the\r\nnatives which can only be compared to their forced #NN# under the\r\n#NNS# upon the old silver #NNS# of Darien.  A #NN# of villainous\r\n#NNS# #VBN# the country, armed such Indians as would #VB#\r\nthem, and turned the rest into #NNS#, #VBG# them with the most\r\ninhuman #NNS# in order to force them to gather the #NN#,\r\nwhich was then #VBD# down the river to Para.  Lord John Roxton\r\n#VBN# on behalf of the wretched victims, and received nothing\r\nbut threats and #NNS# for his pains.  He then formally declared war\r\nagainst Pedro Lopez, the #NN# of the slave-drivers, #VBN# a band\r\nof #JJ# slaves in his service, armed them, and conducted a campaign,\r\nwhich ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious half-breed\r\nand breaking down the system which he represented.",
    "No wonder that the #VBN# man with the #JJ# voice and the free\r\nand easy manners was now looked upon with deep interest upon the #NNS#\r\nof the great South American river, though the feelings he #VBN# were\r\nnaturally mixed, since the #NN# of the natives was #VBD# by the\r\n#NN# of those who desired to exploit them.  One useful result of\r\nhis former experiences was that he could talk #RB# in the #NN#\r\n#JJ#, which is the peculiar talk, #NN# #JJ# and #NNS#\r\nIndian, which is current all over Brazil.",
    "I have said before that Lord John Roxton was a South #NN#.  He\r\ncould not speak of that great country without #NN#, and this ardor was\r\n#JJ#, for, ignorant as I was, he fixed my attention and\r\n#VBN# my curiosity.  How I wish I could #VB# the glamour of\r\nhis #NNS#, the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of #JJ#\r\nimagination which gave them their #NN#, until even the\r\nProfessor's cynical and sceptical smile would gradually #VBP# from his\r\nthin face as he listened.  He would tell the history of the mighty\r\nriver so rapidly explored (for some of the first #NNS# of Peru\r\nactually crossed the #JJ# continent upon its #NNS#), and yet so\r\nunknown in regard to all that lay behind its #JJ# banks.",
    "\"What is there?\" he would #VB#, pointing to the north.  \"#NNP# and #NN#\r\nand #VBN# jungle.  Who knows what it may #NN#?  And there to\r\nthe south?  A #NN# of swampy forest, where no white man has ever\r\nbeen.  The unknown is up against us on every side.  #IN# the narrow\r\nlines of the rivers what does anyone know?  Who will say what is\r\npossible in such a country?  Why should old man Challenger not be\r\nright?\"  At which direct #NN# the #JJ# sneer would reappear\r\nupon Professor Summerlee's face, and he would sit, shaking his #JJ#\r\nhead in unsympathetic silence, behind the cloud of his #NN# pipe.",
    "So much, for the moment, for my two white companions, whose characters\r\nand limitations will be further exposed, as surely as my own, as this\r\nnarrative #NNS#.  But already we have enrolled certain #NNS# who\r\nmay play no small part in what is to come.  The first is a gigantic\r\nnegro named #NN#, who is a black Hercules, as willing as any horse,\r\nand about as intelligent.  #PRP# we #VBD# at Para, on the\r\n#NN# of the #NN# company, on whose vessels he had\r\nlearned to speak a #VBG# English.",
    "It was at Para also that we engaged #NNP# and #NNP#, two half-breeds\r\nfrom up the river, just come down with a cargo of #NN#.  They were\r\nswarthy #NNS#, bearded and fierce, as active and wiry as #NNS#.\r\nBoth of them had spent their lives in those upper waters of the Amazon\r\nwhich we were about to #VB#, and it was this recommendation which\r\nhad caused Lord John to engage them.  One of them, Gomez, had the\r\nfurther advantage that he could speak excellent English.  These men\r\nwere willing to act as our personal servants, to cook, to row, or to\r\nmake themselves useful in any way at a payment of fifteen dollars a\r\nmonth.  Besides these, we had engaged three #NN# Indians from #NNP#,\r\nwho are the most #JJ# at #VBG# and boat work of all the river\r\ntribes.  The chief of these we called Mojo, after his tribe, and the\r\nothers are known as Jose and #NNP#.  Three white men, then, two\r\nhalf-breeds, one negro, and three Indians made up the #NNS# of the\r\nlittle expedition which lay waiting for its instructions at Manaos\r\nbefore starting upon its singular quest.",
    "At last, after a weary week, the day had come and the hour.  I ask you\r\nto picture the #VBN# sitting-room of the Fazenda St.  #NN#, two\r\nmiles inland from the town of Manaos.  Outside lay the yellow, #JJ#\r\nglare of the sunshine, with the shadows of the palm trees as black and\r\ndefinite as the trees themselves.  The air was calm, full of the\r\n#JJ# #NN# of insects, a tropical chorus of many #NNS#, from the\r\ndeep #NN# of the #NN# to the high, keen pipe of the #NN#.  #IN#\r\nthe #NN# was a small cleared garden, bounded with #NNS# hedges and\r\nadorned with #NNS# of #VBG# shrubs, round which the great blue\r\n#NNS# and the tiny #NNS# #VBD# and darted in\r\n#NN# of #JJ# light.  Within we were seated round the #NN#\r\ntable, on which lay a sealed envelope.  #VBN# upon it, in the\r\n#JJ# handwriting of Professor Challenger, were the words:--",
    "\"#NNS# to Lord John Roxton and party.  To be opened at Manaos\r\nupon #RB# 15th, at #CD# o'clock precisely.\"",
    "Lord John had placed his watch upon the table beside him.",
    "\"We have seven more minutes,\" said he.  \"The old dear is very #JJ#.\"",
    "Professor Summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in\r\nhis gaunt hand.",
    "\"What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven\r\nminutes?\" said he.  \"It is all part and parcel of the same system of\r\n#NN# and nonsense, for which I #VBP# to say that the writer is\r\nnotorious.\"",
    "\"Oh, come, we must play the game #NN#' to #NNS#,\" said Lord John.\r\n\"It's old man Challenger's show and we are here by his good will, so it\r\nwould be #JJ# bad form if we didn't follow his instructions to the\r\nletter.\"",
    "\"A pretty business it is!\" cried the Professor, bitterly.  \"It struck\r\nme as preposterous in London, but I'm bound to say that it seems even\r\nmore so upon #JJR# acquaintance.  I don't know what is inside this\r\nenvelope, but, unless it is something pretty definite, I shall be much\r\n#VBN# to take the next #NN# boat and catch the Bolivia at Para.\r\nAfter all, I have some more #JJ# work in the world than to run\r\nabout #VBG# the assertions of a #JJ#.  Now, Roxton, surely it\r\nis time.\"",
    "\"Time it is,\" said Lord John.  \"You can blow the whistle.\" He took up\r\nthe envelope and cut it with his #NN#.  From it he drew a folded\r\nsheet of paper.  This he carefully opened out and #VBN# on the\r\ntable.  It was a blank sheet.  He turned it over.  Again it was blank.\r\nWe looked at each other in a #VBN# silence, which was broken by a\r\n#JJ# burst of #NN# laughter from Professor Summerlee.",
    "\"It is an open admission,\" he cried.  \"What more do you want?  The\r\nfellow is a #JJ# #NN#.  We have only to return home and\r\nreport him as the #JJ# imposter that he is.\"",
    "\"#NNP# ink!\" I suggested.",
    "\"I don't think!\" said Lord Roxton, holding the paper to the light.\r\n\"No, young fellah my lad, there is no use #VBG# yourself.  I'll go\r\n#VB# for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper.\"",
    "\"May I come in?\" boomed a voice from the veranda.",
    "The shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the #NN# of sunlight.\r\nThat voice!  That monstrous breadth of shoulder!  We sprang to our feet\r\nwith a gasp of #NN# as Challenger, in a round, boyish #JJ#\r\nwith a colored #NN#, with his hands in his #NNS#\r\nand his #NNS# shoes #RB# pointing as he #NN# in the\r\nopen space before us.  He threw back his head, and there he stood in\r\nthe golden glow with all his old Assyrian #NN# of beard, all his\r\nnative #NN# of drooping eyelids and intolerant eyes.",
    "\"I fear,\" said he, taking out his watch, \"that I am a few minutes too\r\nlate.  When I gave you this envelope I must confess that I had never\r\nintended that you should open it, for it had been my fixed intention to\r\nbe with you before the hour.  The unfortunate delay can be apportioned\r\nbetween a #VBG# pilot and an intrusive #NN#.  I fear that it\r\nhas given my colleague, Professor Summerlee, occasion to #NN#.\"",
    "\"I am bound to say, sir,\" said Lord John, with some #NN# of voice,\r\n\"that your turning up is a considerable relief to us, for our mission\r\nseemed to have come to a premature end.  Even now I can't for the life\r\nof me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a\r\nmanner.\"",
    "Instead of answering, Professor Challenger entered, shook hands with\r\nmyself and Lord John, bowed with #JJ# insolence to Professor\r\nSummerlee, and sank back into a #NN#, which #VBD# and #VBD#\r\nbeneath his #NN#.",
    "\"Is all ready for your journey?\" he asked.",
    "\"We can start to-morrow.\"",
    "\"Then so you shall.  You need no #NN# of directions now, since you\r\nwill have the #NN# advantage of my own guidance.  From the first\r\nI had determined that I would myself #VB# over your investigation.\r\nThe most elaborate #NNS# would, as you will readily admit, be a poor\r\n#NN# for my own intelligence and advice.  As to the small #NN#\r\nwhich I played upon you in the matter of the envelope, it is clear\r\nthat, had I told you all my #NNS#, I should have been forced to\r\n#VB# unwelcome pressure to travel out with you.\"",
    "\"Not from me, sir!\" exclaimed Professor Summerlee, heartily.  \"So long\r\nas there was another ship upon the Atlantic.\"",
    "Challenger waved him away with his great hairy hand.",
    "\"Your common sense will, I am sure, #VB# my objection and realize\r\nthat it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear\r\nonly at the exact moment when my presence was needed.  That moment has\r\nnow arrived.  You are in safe hands.  You will not now fail to reach\r\nyour destination.  From #RB# I take command of this expedition,\r\nand I must ask you to complete your #NNS# to-night, so that we\r\nmay be able to make an early start in the morning.  My time is of\r\nvalue, and the same thing may be said, no doubt, in a #JJR# degree of\r\nyour own.  I propose, therefore, that we push on as rapidly as\r\npossible, until I have #VBN# what you have come to see.\"",
    "Lord John Roxton has #JJ# a large steam #VB#, the #NN#,\r\nwhich was to carry us up the river.  So far as #NN# goes, it was\r\nimmaterial what time we chose for our expedition, as the temperature\r\n#NNS# from #NN# to ninety #NNS# both #NN# and winter, with\r\nno appreciable difference in heat.  In #NN#, however, it is\r\notherwise; from #NNP# to May is the period of the #NNS#, and during\r\nthis time the river slowly rises until it #VBZ# a height of nearly\r\nforty feet above its #NN# mark.  It #NNS# the banks, extends in\r\ngreat lagoons over a monstrous waste of country, and forms a huge\r\ndistrict, called #RB# the #NN#, which is for the most part too\r\n#NN# for #NN# and too #JJ# for #VBG#.  About #NNP# the\r\nwaters begin to fall, and are at their #JJS# at #NNP# or November.\r\nThus our expedition was at the time of the dry season, when the great\r\nriver and its tributaries were more or less in a #JJ# condition.",
    "The current of the river is a slight one, the drop being not greater\r\nthan eight inches in a mile.  No stream could be more convenient for\r\n#NN#, since the prevailing wind is #NN#, and sailing boats\r\nmay make a #JJ# progress to the Peruvian #NN#, #VBG# down\r\nagain with the current.  In our own case the excellent engines of the\r\nEsmeralda could #NN# the sluggish flow of the stream, and we made\r\nas rapid progress as if we were navigating a stagnant lake.  For three\r\ndays we #VBN# #NN# up a stream which even here, a thousand\r\nmiles from its mouth, was still so enormous that from its center the\r\ntwo banks were mere shadows upon the distant #NN#.  On the fourth\r\nday after leaving Manaos we turned into a #NN# which at its mouth\r\nwas little smaller than the main stream.  It narrowed rapidly, however,\r\nand after two more days' #VBG# we reached an Indian village, where\r\nthe Professor insisted that we should land, and that the Esmeralda\r\nshould be sent back to Manaos.  We should soon come upon rapids, he\r\nexplained, which would make its further use impossible.  He added\r\n#RB# that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country,\r\nand that the #JJR# whom we took into our confidence the better it would\r\nbe.  To this end also he made each of us give our word of honor that we\r\nwould #VB# or say nothing which would give any exact clue as to the\r\n#NNS# of our travels, while the servants were all solemnly sworn\r\nto the same effect.  It is for this reason that I am compelled to be\r\nvague in my narrative, and I would warn my readers that in any map or\r\ndiagram which I may give the relation of places to each other may be\r\ncorrect, but the points of the #NN# are carefully confused, so that\r\nin no way can it be taken as an actual #VB# to the country.  Professor\r\nChallenger's reasons for secrecy may be valid or not, but we had no\r\nchoice but to #VB# them, for he was prepared to #VB# the whole\r\nexpedition rather than modify the conditions upon which he would guide\r\nus.",
    "It was August 2#CC# when we snapped our last link with the outer world by\r\n#VBG# #NN# to the Esmeralda.  Since then four days have passed,\r\nduring which we have engaged two large #NNS# from the Indians, made of\r\nso light a material (#NNS# over a bamboo #NN#) that we should be\r\nable to carry them round any #NN#.  These we have #VBN# with all\r\nour effects, and have engaged two additional Indians to help us in the\r\nnavigation.  I understand that they are the very #NN# and #NN#\r\nby #NN# accompanied Professor Challenger upon his previous\r\njourney.  They appeared to be terrified at the prospect of repeating\r\nit, but the chief has #JJ# powers in these countries, and if the\r\n#NN# is good in his eyes the #NN# has little choice in the\r\nmatter.",
    "So to-morrow we disappear into the unknown.  This account I am\r\n#VBG# down the river by canoe, and it may be our last word to\r\nthose who are interested in our fate.  I have, according to our\r\narrangement, addressed it to you, my dear Mr. McArdle, and I leave it\r\nto your discretion to #VB#, alter, or do what you like with it.  From\r\nthe assurance of Professor Challenger's #NN# in spite of the\r\n#VBN# #NN# of Professor #NN# have no doubt that our\r\nleader will make good his statement, and that we are really on the #NN#\r\nof some most remarkable experiences.",

    "Our friends at home may well #VBP# with us, for we are at our goal,\r\nand up to a point, at least, we have shown that the statement of\r\nProfessor Challenger can be verified.  We have not, it is true,\r\nascended the plateau, but it lies before us, and even Professor\r\nSummerlee is in a more #VBD# mood.  Not that he will for an instant\r\nadmit that his rival could be right, but he is less #JJ# in his\r\n#JJ# objections, and has sunk for the most part into an #JJ#\r\nsilence.  I must #VBP# back, however, and continue my narrative from\r\nwhere I dropped it.  We are sending home one of our local Indians who\r\nis injured, and I am #VBG# this letter to his charge, with\r\nconsiderable doubts in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand.",
    "When I wrote last we were about to leave the Indian village where we\r\nhad been #VBN# by the Esmeralda.  I have to begin my report by bad\r\nnews, for the first serious personal trouble (I pass over the incessant\r\n#NNS# between the #NNP#) occurred this evening, and might\r\nhave had a tragic ending.  I have #VBN# of our #JJ#\r\nhalf-breed, #NN# fine worker and a willing fellow, but afflicted, I\r\nfancy, with the #NN# of curiosity, which is common enough among such\r\nmen.  On the last evening he seems to have #VBD# himself near the #NN# in\r\nwhich we were #VBG# our plans, and, being observed by our huge\r\nnegro Zambo, who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all\r\nhis race bear to the half-breeds, he was dragged out and carried into\r\nour presence.  Gomez #VBD# out his knife, however, and but for the\r\nhuge strength of his captor, which enabled him to #VB# him with one\r\nhand, he would certainly have #VBD# him.  The matter has ended in\r\n#NNS#, the #NNS# have been compelled to #VB# hands, and there\r\nis every hope that all will be well.  As to the #NNS# of the two\r\nlearned men, they are continuous and bitter.  It must be admitted that\r\nChallenger is #JJ# in the last degree, but Summerlee has an acid\r\ntongue, which makes matters worse.  Last night Challenger said that he\r\nnever cared to walk on the Thames #NN# and look up the river, as\r\nit was always sad to see one's own #JJ# goal.  He is convinced, of\r\ncourse, that he is destined for Westminster #NNP#.  Summerlee #VBD#,\r\nhowever, with a #JJ# smile, by saying that he understood that #NN#\r\n#NNP# had been pulled down.  Challenger's #NN# is too colossal to\r\n#VB# him to be really annoyed.  He only smiled in his beard and\r\nrepeated \"Really!  Really!\" in the #VBG# tone one would #VB# to a\r\nchild.  Indeed, they are children #NN# one #VBN# and\r\ncantankerous, the other formidable and #JJ#, yet each with a\r\nbrain which has put him in the front rank of his scientific age.\r\n#NN#, character, #RB# as one sees more of life does one\r\nunderstand how distinct is each.",
    "The very next day we did actually make our start upon this remarkable\r\nexpedition.  We found that all our possessions #VBN# very easily into\r\nthe two canoes, and we divided our personnel, six in each, taking the\r\nobvious precaution in the interests of peace of putting one Professor\r\ninto each canoe.  #RB#, I was with Challenger, who was in a\r\n#JJ# humor, moving about as one in a silent #NN# and #VBG#\r\nbenevolence from every #NN#.  I have had some experience of him in\r\nother #NNS#, however, and shall be the less surprised when the\r\n#NNS# suddenly come up #IN# the sunshine.  If it is\r\nimpossible to be at your ease, it is equally impossible to be dull in\r\nhis company, for one is always in a state of #NNS# doubt as to\r\nwhat sudden turn his formidable temper may take.",
    "For two days we made our way up a #VBN# river some hundreds of\r\nyards broad, and dark in color, but #JJ#, so that one could\r\nusually see the bottom.  The #NNS# of the Amazon are, half of them,\r\nof this nature, while the other half are #JJ# and #JJ#, the\r\ndifference #VBG# upon the class of country through which they have\r\n#VBD#.  The dark indicate vegetable #NN#, while the others point to\r\n#NN# #NN#.  Twice we came across rapids, and in each case made a\r\n#NN# of half a mile or so to avoid them.  The woods on either side\r\nwere #JJ#, which are more easily #VBN# than woods of the\r\nsecond growth, and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes\r\nthrough them.  How shall I ever forget the solemn mystery of it?  The\r\nheight of the trees and the #NN# of the #NNS# #VBD# anything\r\nwhich I in my #VBN# life could have imagined, shooting #RB#s in\r\nmagnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we\r\ncould dimly discern the spot where they threw out their #NN#\r\ninto #JJ# upward #NNS# which #VBN# to form one great matted roof\r\nof #NN#, through which only an occasional golden #NN# of sunshine\r\nshot #NNS# to trace a thin #JJ# line of light amidst the\r\nmajestic obscurity.  As we walked #RB# amid the thick, soft\r\ncarpet of #VBG# vegetation the hush fell upon our souls which comes\r\nupon us in the twilight of the Abbey, and even Professor Challenger's\r\n#VBN# notes sank into a whisper.  Alone, I should have been\r\nignorant of the names of these giant #NNS#, but our men of science\r\npointed out the #NNS#, the great #NN# #NN# trees, and the redwood\r\ntrees, with all that #NN# of various plants which has made this\r\ncontinent the chief #NN# to the human race of those gifts of Nature\r\nwhich depend upon the vegetable world, while it is the most backward in\r\nthose #NNS# which come from animal life.  #JJ# #NNS# and\r\nwonderful colored #NNS# #VBD# upon the swarthy #NNS# and\r\nwhere a wandering #NN# of light fell full upon the golden #NN#,\r\nthe #JJ# #NN# of the #NN#, or the rich deep blue of\r\n#NN#, the effect was as a dream of #NN#.  In these great #NNS#\r\nof forest, life, which #NNS# darkness, struggles ever upwards to the\r\nlight.  Every plant, even the smaller ones, #NNS# and #NNS# to the\r\ngreen #NN#ace, #VBG# itself round its stronger and #JJR# brethren in\r\nthe effort.  #VBG# plants are monstrous and #NN#, but others\r\nwhich have never been known to climb elsewhere learn the art as an\r\nescape from that #JJ# shadow, so that the common #NN#, the #NN#,\r\nand even the #NN# palm tree can be seen #VBG# the #VBZ# of the\r\ncedars and #VBG# to reach their #NNS#.  Of animal life there was no\r\nmovement amid the majestic #VBD# #NNS# which stretched from us as we\r\nwalked, but a constant movement far above our heads told of that\r\n#JJ# world of #NN# and monkey, bird and #NN#, which lived in\r\nthe sunshine, and looked down in wonder at our tiny, dark, #VBG#\r\nfigures in the obscure depths #RB# below them.  At dawn and at\r\n#NN# the #NN# #NNS# screamed together and the #NNS# broke\r\ninto shrill #NN#, but during the hot hours of the day only the full\r\ndrone of insects, like the #NN# of a distant surf, filled the ear,\r\nwhile nothing moved amid the solemn #NNS# of #JJ# trunks, fading\r\naway into the darkness which held us in.  Once some #VBN#,\r\n#VBG# creature, an #NN# or a #NN#, #VBD# #RB# amid the\r\nshadows.  It was the only sign of earth life which I saw in this great\r\n#JJ# forest.",
    "And yet there were indications that even human life itself was not far\r\nfrom us in those mysterious #NN#.  On the third day out we were\r\naware of a singular deep throbbing in the air, #JJ# and solemn,\r\ncoming and going #RB# throughout the morning.  The two boats were\r\n#VBG# within a few yards of each other when first we heard it, and\r\nour Indians remained motionless, as if they had been turned to bronze,\r\nlistening intently with #NNS# of terror upon their faces.",
    "\"What is it, then?\" I asked.",
    "\"#NNS#,\" said Lord John, #RB#; \"war #NNS#.  I have heard them\r\nbefore.\"",
    "\"Yes, sir, war drums,\" said Gomez, the half-breed.  \"#NNP# Indians,\r\n#NNS#, not #NN#; they watch us every mile of the way; kill us if\r\nthey can.\"",
    "\"How can they watch us?\" I asked, gazing into the dark, motionless #NN#.",
    "The half-breed shrugged his broad shoulders.",
    "\"The Indians know.  They have their own way.  They watch us.  They talk\r\nthe #NN# talk to each other.  #VB# us if they can.\"",
    "By the afternoon of that #NN# pocket #NN# shows me that it was\r\nTuesday, August #CD# least six or seven drums were throbbing from\r\nvarious points.  Sometimes they beat quickly, sometimes slowly,\r\nsometimes in obvious question and answer, one far to the east breaking\r\nout in a high #NN# rattle, and being followed after a pause by a\r\ndeep #NN# from the north.  There was something #RB#\r\n#VBG# and menacing in that constant mutter, which seemed to\r\nshape itself into the very #NNS# of the half-breed, #RB#\r\nrepeated, \"We will kill you if we can.  We will kill you if we can.\"\r\nNo one ever moved in the silent woods.  All the peace and soothing of\r\nquiet Nature lay in that dark curtain of vegetation, but away from\r\nbehind there came ever the one message from our #NN#.  \"We will\r\nkill you if we can,\" said the men in the east.  \"We will kill you if we\r\ncan,\" said the men in the north.",
    "All day the drums rumbled and whispered, while their menace reflected\r\nitself in the faces of our colored companions.  Even the #JJ#,\r\nswaggering half-breed seemed cowed.  I learned, however, that day once\r\nfor all that both Summerlee and Challenger possessed that highest type\r\nof #NN#, the bravery of the scientific mind.  #JJ# was the spirit\r\nwhich #VBD# Darwin among the #NNS# of the #JJ# or Wallace among\r\nthe #NNS# of #NN#.  It is #VBD# by a #JJ# Nature that\r\nthe human brain cannot think of two things simultaneously, so that if\r\nit be #VBN# in curiosity as to science it has no room for merely\r\npersonal #NNS#.  All day amid that incessant and mysterious\r\nmenace our two Professors watched every bird upon the wing, and every\r\n#NN# upon the bank, with many a sharp #JJ# #NN#, when the #NN#\r\nof Summerlee came quick upon the deep #NN# of Challenger, but with no\r\nmore sense of danger and no more reference to #VBG# Indians than\r\nif they were seated together in the smoking-room of the #JJ# Society's\r\nClub in St.  James's Street.  Once only did they #NN# to discuss\r\nthem.",
    "\"#NN# or #NN# #NNS#,\" said Challenger, jerking his thumb\r\ntowards the #VBG# wood.",
    "\"No doubt, sir,\" Summerlee answered.  \"Like all such tribes, I shall\r\nexpect to find them of #NN# speech and of #NN# type.\"",
    "\"#NN# certainly,\" said Challenger, indulgently.  \"I am not\r\naware that any other type of language exists in this continent, and I\r\nhave notes of more than a hundred.  The Mongolian theory I regard with\r\ndeep suspicion.\"",
    "\"I should have thought that even a limited knowledge of comparative\r\nanatomy would have helped to verify it,\" said Summerlee, bitterly.",
    "Challenger thrust out his aggressive chin until he was all beard and\r\n#NN#.  \"No doubt, sir, a limited knowledge would have that effect.\r\nWhen one's knowledge is #JJ#, one comes to other conclusions.\"\r\nThey glared at each other in #JJ# defiance, while all round rose the\r\ndistant whisper, \"We will kill #NN# will kill you if we can.\"",
    "That night we #VBN# our canoes with heavy stones for #NNS# in the\r\ncenter of the stream, and made every preparation for a possible attack.\r\nNothing came, however, and with the dawn we pushed upon our way, the\r\ndrum-beating dying out behind us.  About three o'clock in the afternoon\r\nwe came to a very #JJ# rapid, more than a mile #NN# very one in\r\nwhich Professor Challenger had suffered #NN# upon his first\r\njourney.  I confess that the sight of it #VBD# me, for it was really\r\nthe first direct corroboration, slight as it was, of the truth of his\r\nstory.  The Indians carried first our canoes and then our stores\r\nthrough the #NN#, which is very thick at this point, while we four\r\n#NNS#, our rifles on our shoulders, walked between them and any danger\r\ncoming from the woods.  Before evening we had successfully passed the\r\nrapids, and made our way some ten miles above them, where we #VBN#\r\nfor the night.  At this point I #VBN# that we had come not less than\r\na hundred miles up the tributary from the main stream.",
    "It was in the early #NN# of the next day that we made the great\r\ndeparture.  Since dawn Professor Challenger had been #RB# uneasy,\r\ncontinually #VBG# each bank of the river.  Suddenly he gave an\r\nexclamation of satisfaction and pointed to a single tree, which\r\nprojected at a peculiar angle over the side of the stream.",
    "\"What do you make of that?\" he asked.",
    "\"It is surely an #FW# palm,\" said Summerlee.",
    "\"Exactly.  It was an Assai palm which I took for my #NN#.  The\r\nsecret opening is half a mile onwards upon the other side of the river.\r\nThere is no #NN# in the trees.  That is the wonder and the mystery of\r\nit.  There where you see #NN# #VBZ# instead of #JJ#\r\n#NN#, there between the great cotton woods, that is my private\r\ngate into the unknown.  #NN# through, and you will understand.\"",
    "It was indeed a wonderful place.  Having reached the spot marked by a\r\nline of light-green rushes, we #VBN# out two canoes through them for\r\nsome hundreds of yards, and eventually emerged into a placid and\r\nshallow stream, running clear and transparent over a sandy bottom.  It\r\nmay have been twenty yards across, and was banked in on each side by\r\nmost luxuriant vegetation.  No one who had not observed that for a\r\nshort distance #NNS# had taken the place of shrubs, could possibly have\r\nguessed the existence of such a stream or dreamed of the fairyland\r\nbeyond.",
    "For a fairyland it #NN# most wonderful that the imagination of man\r\ncould #VB#.  The thick vegetation met #JJ#, #VBG# into a\r\nnatural #NN#, and through this tunnel of verdure in a golden\r\ntwilight flowed the green, #NN# river, beautiful in itself, but\r\n#JJ# from the strange #NNS# thrown by the #JJ# light from above\r\n#VBN# and #VBN# in its fall.  #NNP# as #JJ#, motionless as a\r\nsheet of glass, green as the edge of an #NN#, it stretched in front\r\nof us under its #JJ# archway, every stroke of our #NNS# sending a\r\nthousand #NNS# across its shining surface.  It was a #JJ# avenue\r\nto a land of #NNS#.  All sign of the Indians had passed away, but\r\nanimal life was more frequent, and the #NN# of the creatures showed\r\nthat they knew nothing of the hunter.  #JJ# little #NN#\r\nmonkeys, with #JJ# teeth and gleaming, mocking eyes, #VBD# at\r\nus as we passed.  With a dull, heavy splash an occasional #NN#\r\nplunged in from the bank.  Once a dark, clumsy tapir stared at us from\r\na gap in the bushes, and then lumbered away through the forest; once,\r\ntoo, the yellow, #JJ# form of a great #NN# whisked amid the\r\nbrushwood, and its green, #JJ# eyes glared hatred at us over its\r\n#JJ# shoulder.  #NNP# life was #JJ#, especially the #VBG# #NNS#,\r\n#NN#, #NN#, and #NNS# gathering in little groups, blue, scarlet, and\r\nwhite, upon every #NN# which #VBN# from the bank, while beneath us the\r\ncrystal water was alive with #NN# of every shape and color.",
    "For three days we made our way up this tunnel of #JJ# green sunshine.\r\nOn the longer #NNS# one could hardly tell as one looked ahead where\r\nthe distant green water ended and the distant green archway began.  The\r\ndeep peace of this strange #NN# was unbroken by any sign of man.",
    "\"No Indian here.  Too much afraid.  Curupuri,\" said Gomez.",
    "\"Curupuri is the spirit of the woods,\" Lord John explained.  \"It's a\r\nname for any kind of devil.  The poor #NNS# think that there is\r\nsomething #JJ# in this direction, and therefore they avoid it.\"",
    "On the third day it became evident that our journey in the canoes could\r\nnot last much longer, for the stream was rapidly growing more shallow.\r\nTwice in as many hours we stuck upon the bottom.  Finally we pulled the\r\nboats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the\r\nriver.  In the morning Lord John and I made our way for a couple of\r\nmiles through the forest, keeping parallel with the stream; but as it\r\ngrew ever #JJR# we returned and reported, what Professor Challenger\r\nhad already suspected, that we had reached the highest point to which\r\nthe canoes could be brought.  We drew them up, therefore, and concealed\r\nthem among the bushes, blazing a tree with our #NNS#, so that we should\r\nfind them again.  Then we #VBN# the various #NNS# among\r\n#NN#, #NN#, food, a #NN#, #NNS#, and the #NN#,\r\n#VBG# our packages, we set forth upon the more laborious stage of\r\nour journey.",
    "An unfortunate quarrel between our #NNS# marked the outset of our\r\nnew stage.  Challenger had from the moment of joining us #VBN#\r\ndirections to the whole party, much to the evident #NN# of\r\nSummerlee.  Now, upon his #VBG# some duty to his #NN#\r\n(it was only the carrying of an #NN# #NN#), the matter suddenly\r\ncame to a head.",
    "\"May I ask, sir,\" said Summerlee, with #JJ# calm, \"in what capacity\r\nyou take it upon yourself to issue these orders?\"",
    "Challenger glared and bristled.",
    "\"I do it, Professor Summerlee, as leader of this expedition.\"",
    "\"I am compelled to tell you, sir, that I do not recognize you in that\r\ncapacity.\"",
    "\"Indeed!\" Challenger bowed with unwieldy #NN#.  \"Perhaps you would\r\ndefine my exact position.\"",
    "\"Yes, sir.  You are a man whose veracity is upon trial, and this\r\ncommittee is here to try it.  You walk, sir, with your #NNS#.\"",
    "\"Dear me!\" said Challenger, seating himself on the side of one of the\r\ncanoes.  \"In that case you will, of course, go on your way, and I will\r\nfollow at my leisure.  If I am not the leader you cannot expect me to\r\nlead.\"",
    "Thank heaven that there were two #JJ# #NN# John Roxton and\r\n#NN# prevent the #NN# and #RB# of our learned Professors\r\nfrom sending us back #JJ# to London.  Such #VBG# and pleading\r\nand explaining before we could get them #VBN#!  Then at last\r\nSummerlee, with his sneer and his pipe, would #VB# #RB#, and\r\nChallenger would come rolling and #VBG# after.  By some good\r\n#NN# we discovered about this time that both our #NN# had the\r\nvery #JJS# opinion of Dr. #NNP# of Edinburgh.  #NN#\r\nthat was our one safety, and every #VBN# situation was #VBN# by\r\nour #VBG# the name of the Scotch zoologist, when both our\r\nProfessors would #VB# a temporary #NN# and friendship in their\r\n#NN# and #NN# of this common rival.",
    "#VBG# in single #VB# along the bank of the stream, we soon found\r\nthat it narrowed down to a mere #NN#, and finally that it lost itself\r\nin a great green morass of #NN# #NN#, into which we sank up to\r\nour knees.  The place was horribly #VBN# by clouds of #NNS# and\r\nevery form of flying #NN#, so we were glad to find solid ground again\r\nand to make a #NN# among the trees, which enabled us to #VB#\r\nthis #JJ# morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so\r\nloud was it with insect life.",
    "On the second day after leaving our canoes we found that the whole\r\ncharacter of the country changed.  Our road was #RB# upwards,\r\nand as we ascended the woods became #JJR# and lost their tropical\r\nluxuriance.  The huge trees of the #JJ# Amazonian plain gave place\r\nto the #NNP# and #NN# #NNS#, growing in scattered clumps, with thick\r\nbrushwood between.  In the #NN# hollows the #NN# palms threw out\r\ntheir #JJ# drooping #NNS#.  We #VBD# entirely by compass, and\r\nonce or twice there were differences of opinion between Challenger and\r\nthe two Indians, when, to quote the Professor's #JJ# words, the\r\nwhole party agreed to \"trust the #JJ# instincts of undeveloped\r\nsavages rather than the highest product of modern European #NN#.\"\r\nThat we were justified in doing so was shown upon the third day, when\r\nChallenger admitted that he recognized several #NNS# of his former\r\njourney, and in one spot we actually came upon four #VBN#\r\nstones, which must have marked a #NN#.",
    "The road still ascended, and we crossed a #VBN# #NN# which took\r\ntwo days to traverse.  The vegetation had again changed, and only the\r\nvegetable ivory tree remained, with a great profusion of wonderful\r\norchids, among which I learned to recognize the rare #NN#\r\n#NN# and the glorious pink and scarlet #NNS# of #NN# and\r\n#NN#.  #JJ# #NNS# with #RB# #NNS# and #VBN#\r\nbanks #VBN# down the shallow #NNS# in the #NN#, and offered good\r\n#NNS# every evening on the banks of some rock-studded #NN#,\r\nwhere #NNS# of little #VBN# fish, about the size and shape of\r\nEnglish #NN#, gave us a #JJ# supper.",
    "On the #JJ# day after leaving the canoes, having done, as I reckon,\r\nabout a hundred and twenty miles, we began to #VB# from the trees,\r\nwhich had grown smaller until they were mere shrubs.  Their place was\r\ntaken by an immense wilderness of bamboo, which grew so thickly that we\r\ncould only #VB# it by #VBG# a #NN# with the #NNS# and\r\n#NNS# of the Indians.  It took us a long day, traveling from seven\r\nin the morning till eight at night, with only two breaks of one hour\r\neach, to get through this obstacle.  Anything more monotonous and\r\n#VBG# could not be imagined, for, even at the most open places, I\r\ncould not see more than ten or twelve yards, while usually my vision\r\nwas limited to the back of Lord John's cotton jacket in front of me,\r\nand to the yellow wall within a foot of me on either side.  From above\r\ncame one thin #NN# of sunshine, and fifteen feet over our heads\r\none saw the #NNS# of the reeds #VBG# against the deep blue sky.  I do\r\nnot know what kind of creatures #VBP# such a #NN#, but several\r\ntimes we heard the plunging of large, heavy animals quite close to us.\r\nFrom their sounds Lord John judged them to be some form of wild #NNS#.\r\nJust as night fell we cleared the #NN# of #NNS#, and at once formed\r\nour camp, exhausted by the interminable day.",
    "#RB# next morning we were again afoot, and found that the character of\r\nthe country had changed once again.  Behind us was the wall of bamboo,\r\nas definite as if it marked the course of a river.  In front was an\r\nopen plain, sloping slightly upwards and dotted with clumps of\r\n#NNS#, the whole curving before us until it ended in a long,\r\n#VBN# ridge.  This we reached about midday, only to find a\r\nshallow #NN# beyond, rising once again into a gentle #NN# which\r\nled to a low, rounded #NN#.  It was here, while we crossed the\r\nfirst of these #NNS#, that an incident occurred which may or may not\r\nhave been important.",
    "Professor Challenger, who with the two local Indians was in the #NNP# of\r\nthe party, stopped suddenly and pointed excitedly to the right.  As he\r\ndid so we saw, at the distance of a mile or so, something which\r\nappeared to be a huge gray bird #NN# slowly up from the ground and #VB#\r\n#RB# off, flying very low and straight, until it was lost among the\r\ntree-ferns.",
    "\"Did you see it?\" cried Challenger, in exultation.  \"Summerlee, did you\r\nsee it?\"",
    "His colleague was staring at the spot where the creature had\r\ndisappeared.",
    "\"What do you claim that it was?\" he asked.",
    "\"To the best of my belief, a pterodactyl.\"",
    "Summerlee burst into derisive laughter \"A #NN#!\" said he.\r\n\"It was a stork, if ever I saw one.\"",
    "Challenger was too furious to speak.  He simply swung his pack upon his\r\nback and continued upon his #NN#.  Lord John came #RB# of me,\r\nhowever, and his face was more grave than was his #JJ#.  He had his\r\n#NNP# glasses in his hand.",
    "\"I #VBN# it before it got over the trees,\" said he. \"I won't\r\n#VB# to say what it was, but I'll risk my reputation as a\r\nsportsman that it wasn't any bird that ever I clapped eyes on in my\r\nlife.\"",
    "So there the matter stands.  Are we really just at the edge of the\r\nunknown, #VBG# the outlying #NNS# of this lost world of which\r\nour leader speaks?  I give you the incident as it occurred and you will\r\nknow as much as I do.  It stands alone, for we saw nothing more which\r\ncould be called remarkable.",
    "And now, my readers, if ever I have any, I have brought you up the\r\nbroad river, and through the #NN# of rushes, and down the green\r\ntunnel, and up the long slope of palm trees, and through the bamboo\r\n#NN#, and across the plain of tree-ferns.  At last our destination lay\r\nin full sight of us.  When we had crossed the second ridge we saw\r\nbefore us an irregular, #JJ# plain, and then the line of high\r\nred cliffs which I have seen in the picture.  There it lies, even as I\r\nwrite, and there can be no question that it is the same.  At the\r\nnearest point it is about seven miles from our present camp, and it\r\ncurves away, stretching as far as I can see.  Challenger #NN# about\r\nlike a prize #NN#, and Summerlee is silent, but still sceptical.\r\nAnother day should bring some of our doubts to an end.  Meanwhile, as\r\nJose, whose arm was pierced by a broken bamboo, #VBZ# upon returning,\r\nI send this letter back in his charge, and only hope that it may\r\neventually come to hand.  I will write again as the occasion serves.  I\r\nhave #VBN# with this a rough chart of our journey, which may have\r\nthe effect of making the account rather #JJR# to understand.",
    "                            CHAPTER IX",
    "                  \"Who could have #VBN# it?\"",
    "A dreadful thing has happened to us.  Who could have #VBN# it?  I\r\ncannot foresee any end to our troubles.  It may be that we are\r\ncondemned to spend our whole lives in this strange, #JJ# place.\r\nI am still so confused that I can hardly think clearly of the facts of\r\nthe present or of the chances of the future.  To my #VBN# senses\r\nthe one seems most terrible and the other as black as night.",
    "No men have ever found themselves in a worse position; nor is there any\r\nuse in disclosing to you our exact #JJ# situation and asking\r\nour friends for a relief party.  Even if they could send one, our fate\r\nwill in all human probability be decided long before it could arrive in\r\nSouth America.",
    "We are, in truth, as far from any human aid as if we were in the #NN#.\r\nIf we are to #VB# through, it is only our own qualities which can save\r\nus.  I have as companions three remarkable men, men of great\r\n#NN# and of #NN# courage.  There lies our one and only hope.\r\nIt is only when I look upon the #VBN# faces of my comrades that I\r\nsee some glimmer through the darkness.  #RB# I trust that I appear\r\nas #JJ# as they.  #RB# I am filled with apprehension.",
    "Let me give you, with as much detail as I can, the sequence of events\r\nwhich have led us to this #NN#.",
    "When I finished my last letter I stated that we were within seven miles\r\nfrom an enormous line of ruddy cliffs, which encircled, beyond all\r\ndoubt, the plateau of which Professor Challenger spoke.  Their height,\r\nas we approached them, seemed to me in some places to be greater than\r\nhe had #VBG# up in parts to at least a thousand #NN#\r\nthey were curiously #VBN#, in a manner which is, I believe,\r\ncharacteristic of basaltic #NNS#.  Something of the sort is to be\r\nseen in #NNP# #NNS# at Edinburgh.  The summit showed every sign of\r\na luxuriant vegetation, with bushes near the edge, and farther back\r\nmany high trees.  There was no indication of any life that we could see.",
    "That night we #VBD# our camp immediately under the #NN# most wild\r\nand #JJ# spot.  The crags above us were not merely perpendicular,\r\nbut curved #NNS# at the top, so that #NN# was out of the question.\r\n#RB# to us was the high thin pinnacle of rock which I believe I\r\nmentioned earlier in this narrative.  It is like a broad red church\r\n#NN#, the top of it being level with the plateau, but a great #NN#\r\n#VBG# between.  On the summit of it there grew one high tree.  Both\r\npinnacle and cliff were #RB# #NN# five or six hundred\r\nfeet, I should think.",
    "\"It was on that,\" said Professor Challenger, pointing to this tree,\r\n\"that the pterodactyl was perched.  I climbed #JJ# up the rock\r\nbefore I shot him.  I am inclined to think that a good #NN# like\r\nmyself could ascend the rock to the top, though he would, of course, be\r\nno nearer to the plateau when he had done so.\"",
    "As Challenger spoke of his pterodactyl I glanced at Professor\r\nSummerlee, and for the first time I seemed to see some signs of a\r\n#VBG# #NN# and repentance.  There was no sneer upon his thin\r\nlips, but, on the contrary, a gray, drawn look of excitement and\r\namazement.  Challenger saw it, too, and #VBD# in the first taste of\r\nvictory.",
    "\"Of course,\" said he,  with his clumsy and ponderous sarcasm,\r\n\"Professor Summerlee will understand that when I speak of a pterodactyl\r\nI mean a #RB# it is the kind of stork which has no feathers, a\r\nleathery skin, membranous #NNS#, and teeth in its #NNS#.\"  He #VBD#\r\nand blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away.",
    "In the morning, after a #JJ# breakfast of coffee and #NN# had\r\nto be #JJ# of our #NN# held a #NN# of war as to the best\r\nmethod of #VBG# to the plateau above us.",
    "Challenger #VBD# with a solemnity as if he were the Lord Chief\r\n#NNP# on the #NNP#.  #NNP# him seated upon a rock, his absurd\r\nboyish straw hat tilted on the back of his head, his supercilious eyes\r\n#VBG# us from under his drooping lids, his great black beard\r\nwagging as he slowly #VBN# our present situation and our future\r\nmovements.",
    "#IN# him you might have seen the three of #NN#, #JJ#,\r\nyoung, and #JJ# after our open-air #JJ#; Summerlee, solemn but\r\nstill critical, behind his eternal pipe; Lord John, as keen as a\r\n#NN#, with his #JJ#, alert figure leaning upon his rifle, and\r\nhis eager eyes fixed eagerly upon the #NN#.  Behind us were #VBN#\r\nthe two swarthy half-breeds and the little knot of Indians, while in\r\nfront and above us #VBN# those huge, ruddy #NNS# of #NNS# which kept\r\nus from our goal.",
    "\"I need not say,\" said our leader, \"that on the occasion of my last\r\nvisit I exhausted every means of climbing the cliff, and where I failed\r\nI do not think that anyone else is likely to #VB#, for I am\r\nsomething of a mountaineer.  I had none of the #NNS# of a\r\n#NN# with me, but I have taken the precaution to bring them\r\nnow.  With their aid I am positive I could climb that detached pinnacle\r\nto the summit; but so long as the main cliff #NNS#, it is vain to\r\nattempt ascending that.  I was hurried upon my last visit by the\r\napproach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supplies.\r\nThese considerations limited my time, and I can only claim that I have\r\n#VBN# about six miles of the cliff to the east of us, #VBG# no\r\npossible way up.  What, then, shall we now do?\"",
    "\"There seems to be only one reasonable course,\" said Professor\r\nSummerlee.  \"If you have explored the east, we should travel along the\r\nbase of the cliff to the west, and seek for a #JJ# point for our\r\nascent.\"",
    "\"That's it,\" said Lord John.  \"The odds are that this plateau is of no\r\ngreat size, and we shall travel round it until we either #NN# an easy\r\nway up it, or come back to the point from which we started.\"",
    "\"I have already explained to our young friend here,\" said Challenger\r\n(he has a way of #VBG# to me as if I were a #NN# child ten years\r\nold), \"that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up\r\nanywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not\r\nbe isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected\r\nso singular an #NN# with the general laws of #JJ#.  Yet I\r\nadmit that there may very well be places where an expert human #NN#\r\nmay reach the summit, and yet a #NNS# and heavy animal be unable to\r\n#VB#.  It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is\r\npossible.\"",
    "\"How do you know that, sir?\" asked Summerlee, sharply.",
    "\"Because my predecessor, the American #NNP# White, actually made such\r\nan ascent.  How otherwise could he have seen the monster which he\r\nsketched in his notebook?\"",
    "\"There you reason somewhat ahead of the #VBN# facts,\" said the\r\nstubborn Summerlee.  \"I admit your plateau, because I have seen it; but\r\nI have not as yet satisfied myself that it #VBZ# any form of life\r\nwhatever.\"",
    "\"What you admit, sir, or what you do not admit, is really of\r\ninconceivably small importance.  I am glad to perceive that the plateau\r\nitself has actually #VBN# itself upon your intelligence.\" He glanced\r\nup at it, and then, to our amazement, he sprang from his rock, and,\r\n#VBG# Summerlee by the neck, he tilted his face into the air.  \"Now\r\nsir!\" he shouted, hoarse with excitement.  \"Do I help you to realize\r\nthat the plateau contains some animal life?\"",
    "I have said that a thick fringe of green #NN# the edge of the\r\ncliff.  Out of this there had emerged a black, glistening object.  As\r\nit came slowly forth and overhung the chasm, we saw that it was a very\r\nlarge snake with a peculiar flat, #NN# head.  It #VBD# and\r\nquivered above us for a minute, the morning sun gleaming upon its\r\n#JJ#, sinuous #NNS#.  Then it slowly drew #NNS# and disappeared.",
    "Summerlee had been so interested that he had stood #VBG# while\r\nChallenger tilted his head into the air.  Now he shook his colleague\r\noff and came back to his dignity.",
    "\"I should be glad, Professor Challenger,\" said he, \"if you could see\r\nyour way to make any remarks which may occur to you without seizing me\r\nby the chin.  Even the appearance of a very ordinary rock #NN# does\r\nnot appear to justify such a liberty.\"",
    "\"But there is life upon the plateau all the same,\" his colleague\r\nreplied in triumph.  \"And now, having demonstrated this important\r\nconclusion so that it is clear to anyone, however #VBN# or obtuse,\r\nI am of opinion that we cannot do better than break up our camp and\r\ntravel to #RB# until we find some means of ascent.\"",
    "The ground at the foot of the cliff was rocky and broken so that the\r\ngoing was slow and difficult.  Suddenly we came, however, upon\r\nsomething which #VBD# our #NNS#.  It was the site of an old\r\n#NN#, with several empty Chicago #NN# #NNS#, a bottle #VBN#\r\n\"#NNP#,\" a broken #NN#, and a quantity of other #NNS#'\r\ndebris.  A crumpled, #VBD# newspaper #VBD# itself as the\r\nChicago #NNP#, though the date had been #VBN#.",
    "\"Not mine,\" said Challenger.  \"It must be Maple White's.\"",
    "Lord John had been gazing curiously at a great #NN# which\r\novershadowed the encampment.  \"I say, look at this,\" said he.  \"I\r\nbelieve it is meant for a #NN#.\"",
    "A slip of hard wood had been #VBN# to the tree in such a way as to\r\npoint to the westward.",
    "\"Most certainly a sign-post,\" said Challenger.  \"What else?  Finding\r\nhimself upon a dangerous #NN#, our #NN# has left this sign so that\r\nany party which follows him may know the way he has taken.  Perhaps we\r\nshall come upon some other indications as we proceed.\"",
    "We did indeed, but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature.\r\n#RB# beneath the cliff there grew a considerable patch of high\r\nbamboo, like that which we had #VBN# in our journey.  Many of these\r\nstems were twenty feet high, with sharp, strong tops, so that even as\r\nthey stood they made formidable #NN#.  We were passing along the edge\r\nof this cover when my eye was caught by the gleam of something white\r\nwithin it.  #VBG# in my head between the stems, I found myself\r\ngazing at a #NN# skull.  The whole skeleton was there, but the\r\nskull had detached itself and lay some feet nearer to the open.",
    "With a few blows from the machetes of our Indians we cleared the spot\r\nand were able to study the details of this old tragedy.  Only a few\r\n#NNS# of clothes could still be distinguished, but there were the\r\nremains of boots upon the #JJ# feet, and it was very clear that the\r\ndead man was a European.  A gold watch by Hudson, of New York, and a\r\nchain which held a #NN# pen, lay among the bones.  There was\r\nalso a silver #NN#, with \"J. C., from A. E. S.,\" upon the\r\nlid.  The state of the metal seemed to show that the catastrophe had\r\noccurred no great time before.",
    "\"Who can he be?\" asked Lord John.  \"Poor devil! every bone in his body\r\nseems to be broken.\"",
    "\"And the bamboo grows through his smashed ribs,\" said Summerlee.  \"It\r\nis a #JJ# plant, but it is surely inconceivable that this body\r\ncould have been here while the #NNS# grew to be twenty feet in length.\"",
    "\"As to the man's identity,\" said Professor Challenger, \"I have no doubt\r\nwhatever upon that point.  As I made my way up the river before I\r\nreached you at the #NN# I #VBN# very particular inquiries about\r\nMaple White.  At Para they knew nothing.  Fortunately, I had a definite\r\n#NN#, for there was a particular picture in his sketch-book which\r\nshowed him taking lunch with a certain ecclesiastic at Rosario.  This\r\npriest I was able to find, and though he proved a very #NN#\r\nfellow, who took it #RB# amiss that I should point out to him the\r\n#JJ# effect which modern science must have upon his #NNS#, he\r\nnone the less gave me some positive information.  Maple White passed\r\nRosario four years ago, or two years before I saw his dead body.  He\r\nwas not alone at the time, but there was a friend, an American named\r\nJames Colver, who remained in the boat and did not meet this\r\necclesiastic.  I think, therefore, that there can be no doubt that we\r\nare now looking upon the remains of this James Colver.\"",
    "\"Nor,\" said Lord John, \"is there much doubt as to how he met his death.\r\nHe has fallen or been #VBD# from the top, and so been #VBN#.  How\r\nelse could he come by his broken bones, and how could he have been\r\nstuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads?\"",
    "A hush came over us as we stood round these shattered remains and\r\nrealized the truth of Lord John Roxton's words.  The #JJ# head of\r\nthe cliff projected over the #NN#.  Undoubtedly he had fallen\r\nfrom above.  But had he fallen?  Had it been an accident?  #NN#\r\n#JJ# and terrible possibilities began to form round that unknown\r\nland.",
    "We moved off in silence, and continued to coast round the line of\r\ncliffs, which were as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous\r\n#NNP# #NNS# which I have seen #VBN# as stretching from\r\nhorizon to horizon and #JJ# high above the #NN# of the\r\n#VBG# vessel.",
    "In five miles we saw no #NN# or break.  And then suddenly we perceived\r\nsomething which filled us with new hope.  In a hollow of the rock,\r\n#VBN# from rain, there was drawn a rough #NN# in chalk, pointing\r\nstill to the #NNS#.",
    "\"Maple White again,\" said Professor Challenger.  \"He had some\r\npresentiment that worthy footsteps would follow close behind him.\"",
    "\"He had chalk, then?\"",
    "\"A box of colored chalks was among the effects I found in his knapsack.\r\nI remember that the white one was worn to a #NN#.\"",
    "\"That is certainly good evidence,\" said Summerlee.  \"We can only accept\r\nhis guidance and follow on to the westward.\"",
    "We had proceeded some five more miles when again we saw a white arrow\r\nupon the rocks.  It was at a point where the face of the cliff was for\r\nthe first time split into a narrow cleft.  Inside the cleft was a\r\nsecond guidance mark, which pointed right up it with the #NN# somewhat\r\nelevated, as if the spot indicated were above the level of the ground.",
    "It was a solemn place, for the walls were so gigantic and the #NN# of\r\nblue sky so narrow and so #VBN# by a double fringe of verdure, that\r\nonly a dim and #JJ# light penetrated to the bottom.  We had had no\r\nfood for many hours, and were very weary with the #JJ# and irregular\r\njourney, but our nerves were too strung to allow us to halt.  We\r\nordered the camp to be pitched, however, and, leaving the Indians to\r\narrange it, we four, with the two half-breeds, proceeded up the narrow\r\n#NN#.",
    "It was not more than forty feet across at the mouth, but it rapidly\r\nclosed until it ended in an #JJ# angle, too straight and smooth for an\r\nascent.  Certainly it was not this which our pioneer had attempted to\r\nindicate.  We made our way #NN# whole gorge was not more than a\r\nquarter of a mile #NN# then suddenly the quick eyes of Lord John\r\nfell upon what we were seeking.  High up above our heads, amid the dark\r\nshadows, there was one circle of deeper gloom.  Surely it could only be\r\nthe opening of a cave.",
    "The base of the cliff was heaped with loose stones at the spot, and it\r\nwas not difficult to #NN# up.  When we reached it, all doubt was\r\nremoved.  Not only was it an opening into the rock, but on the side of\r\nit there was marked once again the sign of the arrow.  Here was the\r\npoint, and this the means by which Maple White and his #JJ#\r\ncomrade had made their ascent.",
    "We were too excited to return to the camp, but must make our first\r\n#NN# at once.  Lord John had an electric #NN# in his knapsack,\r\nand this had to serve us as light.  He advanced, throwing his little\r\nclear #NN# of yellow radiance before him, while in single file we\r\nfollowed at his heels.",
    "The cave had evidently been #NN#, the sides being smooth and the\r\nfloor covered with rounded stones.  It was of such a size that a single\r\nman could just fit through by stooping.  For fifty yards it ran almost\r\nstraight into the rock, and then it ascended at an angle of #NN#.\r\nPresently this incline became even #JJR#, and we found ourselves\r\nclimbing upon hands and knees among loose #NN# which slid from\r\nbeneath us.  Suddenly an exclamation broke from Lord Roxton.",
    "\"It's #VBN#!\" said he.",
    "#VBG# behind him we saw in the yellow field of light a wall of\r\nbroken #NN# which extended to the ceiling.",
    "\"The roof has fallen in!\"",
    "In vain we dragged out some of the pieces.  The only effect was that\r\nthe larger ones became detached and #VBN# to roll down the\r\n#NN# and #NN# us.  It was evident that the obstacle was far beyond\r\nany #NNS# which we could make to remove it.  The road by which Maple\r\nWhite had ascended was no longer available.",
    "Too much cast down to speak, we stumbled down the dark tunnel and made\r\nour way back to the camp.",
    "One incident occurred, however, before we left the gorge, which is of\r\nimportance in view of what came afterwards.",
    "We had gathered in a little group at the bottom of the chasm, some\r\nforty feet beneath the mouth of the cave, when a huge rock rolled\r\nsuddenly #NN# shot past us with tremendous force.  It was the\r\n#JJS# escape for one or all of us.  We could not ourselves see\r\nwhence the rock had come, but our half-breed servants, who were still\r\nat the opening of the cave, said that it had flown past them, and must\r\ntherefore have fallen from the summit.  Looking upwards, we could see\r\nno sign of movement above us amidst the green jungle which #VBD# the\r\ncliff.  There could be little doubt, however, that the stone was #VBN#\r\nat us, so the incident surely pointed to #NN# malevolent\r\n#NN# the plateau.",
    "We withdrew hurriedly from the chasm, our minds full of this new\r\ndevelopment and its bearing upon our plans.  The situation was\r\ndifficult enough before, but if the #NN# of Nature were\r\nincreased by the deliberate #NN# of man, then our case was indeed\r\na hopeless one.  And yet, as we looked up at that beautiful fringe of\r\nverdure only a few hundreds of feet above our heads, there was not one\r\nof us who could conceive the idea of returning to London until we had\r\nexplored it to its depths.",
    "On discussing the situation, we determined that our best course was to\r\ncontinue to coast round the plateau in the hope of finding some other\r\nmeans of reaching the top.  The line of cliffs, which had #VBD#\r\nconsiderably in height, had already begun to trend from west to north,\r\nand if we could take this as #VBG# the #NN# of a circle, the\r\nwhole #NN# could not be very great.  At the worst, then, we\r\nshould be back in a few days at our starting-point.",
    "We made a march that day which #VBD# some #NN# miles,\r\nwithout any change in our #NNS#.  I may mention that our aneroid\r\nshows us that in the #JJ# incline which we have ascended since we\r\nabandoned our canoes we have risen to no less than three thousand feet\r\nabove #NN#.  Hence there is a considerable change both in the\r\ntemperature and in the vegetation.  We have shaken off some of that\r\nhorrible insect life which is the #NN# of tropical travel.  A few palms\r\nstill survive, and many tree-ferns, but the Amazonian trees have been\r\nall left behind.  It was pleasant to see the #NNS#, the\r\n#NN#, and the #NN#, all #VBG# me of home, here among\r\nthese #JJ# rocks.  There was a red begonia just the same color\r\nas one that is kept in a pot in the window of a certain villa in\r\n#NN# I am drifting into private #NN#.",
    "That #NN# am still speaking of the first day of our\r\n#NN# of the #NN# great experience awaited us, and one\r\nwhich for ever set at rest any doubt which we could have had as to the\r\nwonders so near us.",
    "You will realize as you read it, my dear Mr. McArdle, and possibly for\r\nthe first time that the paper has not sent me on a wild-goose chase,\r\nand that there is inconceivably fine copy waiting for the world\r\nwhenever we have the Professor's leave to make use of it.  I shall not\r\ndare to publish these articles unless I can bring back my proofs to\r\nEngland, or I shall be hailed as the journalistic #NN# of all\r\ntime.  I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that\r\nyou would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this\r\nadventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism\r\nwhich such articles must of necessity elicit.  So this wonderful\r\nincident, which would make such a headline for the old paper, must\r\nstill wait its turn in the #JJ# drawer.",
    "And yet it was all over in a flash, and there was no sequel to it, save\r\nin our own #NNS#.",
    "What occurred was this.  Lord John had shot an #NN# is a\r\nsmall, pig-like #NN#, half of it having been given to the\r\nIndians, we were #VBG# the other half upon our fire.  There is a\r\nchill in the  air after dark, and we had all drawn close to the blaze.\r\nThe night was #NN#, but there were some stars, and one could see\r\nfor a little distance across the plain.  Well, suddenly out of the\r\ndarkness, out of the night, there #VBD# something with a #NN# like\r\nan #NN#.  The whole group of us were covered for an instant by a\r\n#NN# of leathery wings, and I had a #JJ# vision of a long,\r\n#JJ# neck, a fierce, red, greedy eye, and a great #VBG# beak,\r\nfilled, to my amazement, with little, gleaming teeth.  The next instant\r\nit was #NN# so was our dinner.  A huge black shadow, twenty feet\r\nacross, #VBD# up into the air; for an instant the monster wings\r\n#VBD# out the stars, and then it vanished over the brow of the cliff\r\nabove us.  We all sat in amazed silence round the fire, like the #NNS#\r\nof #NNP# when the #NNS# came down upon them.  It was Summerlee who\r\nwas the first to speak.",
    "\"Professor Challenger,\" said he, in a solemn voice, which #VBD# with\r\nemotion, \"I owe you an apology.  Sir, I am very much in the wrong, and\r\nI beg that you will forget what is past.\"",
    "It was #RB# said, and the two men for the first time shook hands.\r\nSo much we have gained by this clear vision of our first pterodactyl.\r\nIt was worth a stolen supper to bring two such men together.",
    "But if prehistoric life existed upon the plateau it was not\r\n#NN#, for we had no further glimpse of it during the next\r\nthree days.  During this time we traversed a barren and #VBG#\r\ncountry, which alternated between stony #NN# and desolate #NNS#\r\nfull of many #NN#, upon the north and east of the cliffs.  From\r\nthat direction the place is really inaccessible, and, were it not for a\r\n#NN# #NN# which runs at the very base of the precipice, we should\r\nhave had to turn back.  Many times we were up to our #NNS# in the\r\n#NN# and #NN# of an old, #JJ# #NN#.  To make matters\r\nworse, the place seemed to be a favorite #NN# of the #NN#\r\nsnake, the most venomous and aggressive in South America.  Again and\r\nagain these horrible creatures came writhing and springing towards us\r\nacross the surface of this #NN# #VB#, and it was only by keeping our\r\n#NN# for ever ready that we could feel safe from them.  One\r\n#VBN# #NN# in the morass, of a #JJ# green in color from\r\nsome #NN# which #VBN# in it, will always remain as a #NN#\r\nmemory in my mind.  It seems to have been a special #NN# of these\r\n#NNS#, and the #NNS# were alive with them, all writhing in our\r\ndirection, for it is a #NN# of the Jaracaca that he will always\r\nattack man at first sight.  There were too many for us to shoot, so we\r\nfairly took to our heels and ran until we were exhausted.  I shall\r\nalways remember as we looked back how far behind we could see the heads\r\nand necks of our horrible pursuers rising and falling amid the reeds.\r\nJaracaca #NN# we named it in the map which we are #VBG#.",
    "The cliffs upon the farther side had lost their ruddy #VBP#, being\r\n#NN# in color; the vegetation was more scattered along the\r\ntop of them, and they had sunk to three or four hundred feet in height,\r\nbut in no place did we find any point where they could be ascended.  If\r\nanything, they were more impossible than at the first point where we\r\nhad met them.  Their absolute #NN# is indicated in the photograph\r\nwhich I took over the stony desert.",
    "\"Surely,\" said I, as we #VBN# the situation, \"the rain must find\r\nits way down #RB#.  There are bound to be #NNS# in the\r\nrocks.\"",
    "\"Our young friend has #NNS# of lucidity,\" said Professor Challenger,\r\npatting me upon the shoulder.",
    "\"The rain must go somewhere,\" I repeated.",
    "\"He #VBZ# a firm grip upon #NN#.  The only #NN# is that we\r\nhave #RB# proved by #JJ# demonstration that there are no\r\nwater #NNS# down the rocks.\"",
    "\"Where, then, does it go?\" I #VBD#.",
    "\"I think it may be fairly #VBN# that if it does not come outwards it\r\nmust run inwards.\"",
    "\"Then there is a lake in the center.\"",
    "\"So I should suppose.\"",
    "\"It is more than likely that the lake may be an old #NN#,\" said\r\nSummerlee.  \"The whole formation is, of course, highly volcanic.  But,\r\nhowever that may be, I should expect to find the surface of the plateau\r\nslope inwards with a considerable sheet of water in the center, which\r\nmay #NN# off, by some #JJ# #NN#, into the marshes of the\r\nJaracaca Swamp.\"",
    "\"Or #NN# might #VB# an #NN#,\" remarked Challenger,\r\nand the two learned men #VBD# off into one of their usual scientific\r\n#NNS#, which were as #NN# as Chinese to the layman.",
    "On the sixth day we completed our first circuit of the cliffs, and\r\nfound ourselves back at the first camp, beside the isolated pinnacle of\r\nrock.  We were a #NN# party, for nothing could have been more\r\nminute than our investigation, and it was absolutely certain that there\r\nwas no single point where the most active human being could possibly\r\nhope to scale the cliff.  The place which Maple White's #NNS# had\r\nindicated as his own means of access was now entirely #JJ#.",
    "What were we to do now?  Our stores of #NNS#, #VBN# by our\r\nguns, were holding out well, but the day must come when they would need\r\n#NN#.  In a couple of months the rains might be expected, and\r\nwe should be washed out of our camp.  The rock was harder than marble,\r\nand any attempt at cutting a path for so great a height was more than\r\nour time or resources would admit.  No wonder that we looked gloomily\r\nat each other that night, and #VBD# our blankets with hardly a word\r\n#VBN#.  I remember that as I dropped off to sleep my last\r\nrecollection was that Challenger was #VBG#, like a monstrous\r\nbull-frog, by the fire, his huge head in his hands, sunk apparently in\r\nthe deepest thought, and entirely #JJ# to the #JJ# which I\r\nwished him.",
    "But it was a very different Challenger who greeted us in the #NN#\r\nChallenger with #NN# and #NN# shining from his\r\nwhole person.  He faced us as we #VBN# for breakfast with a\r\n#VBG# false #NN# in his eyes, as who should say, \"I know that\r\nI #VBP# all that you can say, but I pray you to spare my #NNS# by\r\nnot saying it.\"  His beard bristled #RB#, his chest was thrown\r\nout, and his hand was thrust into the front of his jacket.  So, in his\r\nfancy, may he see himself sometimes, #VBG# the vacant pedestal in\r\n#NN# Square, and #VBG# one more to the #NNS# of the London\r\nstreets.",
    "\"#NNP#!\" he cried, his teeth shining through his beard.  \"Gentlemen,\r\nyou may congratulate me and we may congratulate each other.  The\r\nproblem is solved.\"",
    "\"You have found a way up?\"",
    "\"I venture to think so.\"",
    "\"And where?\"",
    "For answer he pointed to the #NN# pinnacle upon our right.",
    "Our #NN# mine, at #NN# as we surveyed it.  That it could be\r\nclimbed we had our companion's assurance.  But a horrible #NN# lay\r\nbetween it and the plateau.",
    "\"We can never get across,\" I gasped.",
    "\"We can at least all #NN# the summit,\" said he.  \"When we are up I may\r\nbe able to show you that the resources of an #JJ# mind are not yet\r\nexhausted.\"",
    "After breakfast we #JJ# the #NN# in which our leader had brought\r\nhis climbing #NNS#.  From it he took a #NN# of the strongest and\r\n#JJS# rope, a hundred and fifty feet in length, with climbing #NNS#,\r\n#NNS#, and other #NNS#.  Lord John was an experienced mountaineer,\r\nand Summerlee had done some rough climbing at various times, so that I\r\nwas really the #NN# at #NN# of the party; but my strength and\r\nactivity may have made up for my want of experience.",
    "It was not in reality a very #JJ# task, though there were moments\r\nwhich made my hair #VBP# upon my head.  The first half was perfectly\r\neasy, but from there upwards it became continually steeper until, for\r\nthe last fifty feet, we were #RB# #VBG# with our fingers and\r\ntoes to tiny #NNS# and #NNS# in the rock.  I could not have\r\naccomplished it, nor could Summerlee, if Challenger had not gained the\r\nsummit (it was extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy a\r\ncreature) and there fixed the rope round the trunk of the considerable\r\ntree which grew there.  With this as our support, we were soon able to\r\n#NN# up the jagged wall until we found ourselves upon the small\r\ngrassy platform, some #NN# feet each way, which formed the\r\nsummit.",
    "The first impression which I received when I had recovered my breath\r\nwas of the extraordinary view over the country which we had traversed.\r\nThe whole Brazilian plain seemed to lie beneath us, #VBG# away and\r\naway until it ended in dim blue mists upon the #JJS# sky-line.  In\r\nthe foreground was the long slope, #VBN# with rocks and dotted with\r\ntree-ferns; farther off in the middle distance, looking over the\r\n#NN# hill, I could just see the yellow and green mass of bamboos\r\nthrough which we had passed; and then, gradually, the vegetation\r\nincreased until it formed the huge forest which extended as far as the\r\neyes could reach, and for a good two thousand miles beyond.",
    "I was still drinking in this wonderful #NN# when the heavy hand of\r\nthe Professor fell upon my shoulder.",
    "\"This way, my young friend,\" said he; \"#NN# #NN# #NN#.  Never\r\nlook #NNS#, but always to our glorious goal.\"",
    "The level of the plateau, when I turned, was exactly that on which we\r\nstood, and the green bank of bushes, with occasional trees, was so near\r\nthat it was difficult to realize how inaccessible it remained.  At a\r\nrough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see,\r\nit might as well have been forty miles.  I placed one arm round the\r\ntrunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss.  #NNP# down were the small\r\ndark figures of our servants, looking up at us.  The wall was\r\nabsolutely #JJ#, as was that which faced me.",
    "\"This is indeed curious,\" said the creaking voice of Professor\r\nSummerlee.",
    "I turned, and found that he was examining with great interest the tree\r\nto which I clung.  That smooth #NN# and those small, ribbed leaves\r\nseemed familiar to my eyes.  \"Why,\" I cried, \"it's a #NN#!\"",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Summerlee.  \"A fellow-countryman in a far land.\"",
    "\"Not only a fellow-countryman, my good sir,\" said Challenger, \"but\r\nalso, if I may be allowed to enlarge your #NN#, an ally of the first\r\nvalue.  This beech tree will be our #NN#.\"",
    "\"By George!\" cried Lord John, \"a bridge!\"",
    "\"Exactly, my friends, a bridge!  It is not for nothing that I expended\r\nan hour last night in #VBG# my mind upon the situation.  I have some\r\nrecollection of once remarking to our young friend here that G. E. C.\r\nis at his best when his back is to the wall.  Last night you will admit\r\nthat all our #NNS# were to the wall.  But where #NN# and\r\nintellect go together, there is always a way out.  A #NN# had to\r\nbe found which could be dropped across the abyss.  Behold it!\"",
    "It was certainly a #JJ# idea.  The tree was a good sixty feet in\r\nheight, and if it only fell the right way it would easily cross the\r\nchasm.  Challenger had #VBD# the camp #NN# over his shoulder when he\r\nascended.  Now he handed it to me.",
    "\"Our young friend has the #NNS# and #NNS#,\" said he.  \"I think he will\r\nbe the most useful at this task.  I must beg, however, that you will\r\nkindly #VB# from thinking for yourself, and that you will do exactly\r\nwhat you are told.\"",
    "Under his direction I cut such #NNS# in the sides of the trees as\r\nwould #VB# that it should fall as we desired.  It had already a\r\nstrong, natural #NN# in the direction of the plateau, so that the\r\nmatter was not difficult.  Finally I set to work in earnest upon the\r\ntrunk, taking turn and turn with Lord John.  In a little over an hour\r\nthere was a loud #NN#, the tree swayed forward, and then crashed over,\r\n#VBG# its branches among the bushes on the farther side.  The severed\r\ntrunk rolled to the very edge of our platform, and for one terrible\r\nsecond we all thought it was over.  It #JJ# itself, however, a few\r\ninches from the edge, and there was our bridge to the unknown.",
    "All of us, without a word, shook hands with Professor Challenger, who\r\nraised his straw hat and bowed deeply to each in turn.",
    "\"I claim the honor,\" said he, \"to be the first to cross to the unknown\r\n#NN# fitting subject, no doubt, for some future historical painting.\"",
    "He had approached the bridge when Lord John laid his hand upon his coat.",
    "\"My dear chap,\" said he, \"I really cannot allow it.\"",
    "\"#MD# allow it, sir!\"  The head went back and the beard forward.",
    "\"When it is a matter of science, don't you know, I follow your lead\r\nbecause you are by way of #VBG#' a man of science.  But it's up to you\r\nto follow me when you come into my department.\"",
    "\"Your department, sir?\"",
    "\"We all have our #NNS#, and #NN#' is mine.  We are,\r\naccordin' to my ideas, #NN#' a new country, which may or may not be\r\n#NN# of enemies of #NNS#.  To #NN# #RB# into it for want of a\r\nlittle common sense and patience isn't my notion of #NN#.\"",
    "The remonstrance was too reasonable to be #VBD#.  Challenger\r\ntossed his head and shrugged his heavy shoulders.",
    "\"Well, sir, what do you propose?\"",
    "\"For all I know there may be a tribe of cannibals #NN#' for\r\n#NN# among those very bushes,\" said Lord John, looking across the\r\nbridge.  \"It's better to learn wisdom before you get into a\r\n#NN#'#NN#; so we will content ourselves with #NN#' that there is no\r\ntrouble waitin' for us, and at the same time we will act as if there\r\nwere.  Malone and I will go down again, therefore, and we will fetch up\r\nthe four rifles, together with Gomez and the other.  One man can then\r\ngo across and the rest will cover him with guns, until he sees that it\r\nis safe for the whole crowd to come along.\"",
    "Challenger sat down upon the #NN# stump and groaned his impatience; but\r\nSummerlee and I were of one mind that Lord John was our leader when\r\nsuch practical details were in question.  The #NN# was a more simple\r\nthing now that the rope #VBD# down the face of the worst part of the\r\nascent.  Within an hour we had brought up the rifles and a shot-gun.\r\nThe half-breeds had ascended also, and under Lord John's orders they\r\nhad carried up a #NN# of provisions in case our first exploration\r\nshould be a long one.  We had each #NNS# of cartridges.",
    "\"Now, Challenger, if you really insist upon being the first man in,\"\r\nsaid Lord John, when every preparation was complete.",
    "\"I am much indebted to you for your gracious permission,\" said the\r\nangry Professor; for never was a man so intolerant of every form of\r\nauthority.  \"Since you are good enough to allow it, I shall most\r\ncertainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion.\"",
    "#VBG# himself with a leg overhanging the abyss on each side, and his\r\nhatchet slung upon his back, Challenger #VBD# his way across the trunk\r\nand was soon at the other side.  He #VBD# up and waved his arms in\r\nthe air.",
    "\"At last!\" he cried; \"at last!\"",
    "I gazed #RB# at him, with a vague expectation that some terrible\r\nfate would #VB# at him from the curtain of green behind him.  But all\r\nwas quiet, save that a strange, #VBN# bird flew up from under\r\nhis feet and vanished among the trees.",
    "Summerlee was the second.  His wiry energy is wonderful in so frail a\r\nframe.  He insisted upon having two rifles slung upon his back, so that\r\nboth Professors were armed when he had made his #NN#.  I came next,\r\nand tried hard not to look down into the horrible gulf over which I was\r\npassing.  Summerlee held out the #NN# of his rifle, and an instant\r\nlater I was able to grasp his hand.  As to Lord John, he walked\r\n#RB# walked without support!  He must have nerves of iron.",
    "And there we were, the four of us, upon the #NN#, the lost world,\r\nof Maple White.  To all of us it seemed the moment of our #NN#\r\ntriumph.  Who could have guessed that it was the prelude to our supreme\r\ndisaster?  Let me say in a few words how the crushing blow fell upon us.",
    "We had turned away from the edge, and had penetrated about fifty yards\r\nof close brushwood, when there came a frightful #VBG# crash from\r\nbehind us.  With one #NN# we rushed back the way that we had come.\r\nThe bridge was gone!",
    "Far down at the base of the cliff I saw, as I looked over, a tangled\r\nmass of branches and #JJ# trunk.  It was our beech tree.  Had the\r\nedge of the platform #VBD# and let it through?  For a moment this\r\nexplanation was in all our minds.  The next, from the farther side of\r\nthe rocky pinnacle before us a swarthy face, the face of Gomez the\r\nhalf-breed, was slowly protruded.  Yes, it was Gomez, but no longer the\r\nGomez of the demure smile and the #NN# expression.  Here was a\r\nface with #VBG# eyes and #VBN# features, a face convulsed with\r\nhatred and with the mad joy of #VBN# revenge.",
    "\"Lord Roxton!\" he shouted.  \"Lord John Roxton!\"",
    "\"Well,\" said our companion, \"here I am.\"",
    "A #NN# of laughter came across the abyss.",
    "\"Yes, there you are, you English dog, and there you will remain!  I\r\nhave waited and waited, and now has come my chance.  You found it hard\r\nto get up; you will find it harder to get down.  You cursed fools, you\r\nare #VBN#, every one of you!\"",
    "We were too astounded to speak.  We could only stand there staring in\r\namazement.  A great broken #NN# upon the grass showed whence he had\r\ngained his #NN# to tilt over our bridge.  The face had vanished,\r\nbut presently it was up again, more frantic than before.",
    "\"We nearly killed you with a stone at the cave,\" he cried; \"but this is\r\nbetter.  It is #JJR# and more terrible.  Your bones will #NN# up\r\nthere, and none will know where you lie or come to cover them.  As you\r\nlie dying, think of Lopez, whom you shot five years ago on the Putomayo\r\nRiver.  I am his brother, and, come what will I will die happy now, for\r\nhis memory has been #VBN#.\" A furious hand was shaken at us, and then\r\nall was quiet.",
    "Had the half-breed simply wrought his vengeance and then escaped, all\r\nmight have been well with him.  It was that foolish, #JJ# Latin\r\nimpulse to be dramatic which brought his own downfall.  Roxton, the man\r\nwho had earned himself the name of the Flail of the Lord through three\r\ncountries, was not one who could be safely #VBD#.  The half-breed was\r\ndescending on the farther side of the pinnacle; but before he could\r\nreach the ground Lord John had run along the edge of the plateau and\r\ngained a point from which he could see his man.  There was a single\r\ncrack of his rifle, and, though we saw nothing, we heard the #NN# and\r\nthen the distant thud of the falling body.  Roxton came back to us with\r\na face of granite.",
    "\"I have been a blind #NN#,\" said he, bitterly,  \"It's my folly\r\nthat has brought you all into this trouble.  I should have remembered\r\nthat these people have long #NNS# for #NNS#, and have been\r\nmore upon my guard.\"",
    "\"What about the other one?  It took two of them to #NN# that tree over\r\nthe edge.\"",
    "\"I could have shot him, but I let him go.  He may have had no part in\r\nit.  Perhaps it would have been better if I had killed him, for he\r\nmust, as you say, have lent a hand.\"",
    "Now that we had the clue to his action, each of us could cast back and\r\nremember some sinister act upon the part of the #NNS#\r\nconstant desire to know our plans, his arrest outside our tent when he\r\nwas #VBG# them, the furtive looks of hatred which from time to\r\ntime one or other of us had surprised.  We were still discussing it,\r\n#VBG# to #VB# our minds to these new conditions, when a\r\nsingular scene in the plain below arrested our attention.",
    "A man in white clothes, who could only be the #VBG# half-breed, was\r\nrunning as one does run when Death is the #NN#.  Behind him, only\r\na few yards in his #JJ#, bounded the huge #NN# figure of Zambo, our\r\ndevoted negro.  Even as we looked, he sprang upon the back of the\r\nfugitive and flung his arms round his neck.  They rolled on the ground\r\ntogether.  An instant afterwards Zambo rose, looked at the prostrate\r\nman, and then, waving his hand #RB# to us, came running in our\r\ndirection.  The white figure lay motionless in the middle of the great\r\nplain.",
    "Our two traitors had been destroyed, but the mischief that they had\r\ndone lived after them.  By no possible means could we get back to the\r\npinnacle.  We had been natives of the world; now we were natives of the\r\nplateau.  The two things were separate and apart.  There was the plain\r\nwhich led to the canoes.  #NN#, beyond the #NN#, hazy horizon, was\r\nthe stream which led back to civilization.  But the link between was\r\nmissing.  No human ingenuity could suggest a means of #VBG# the\r\nchasm which #VBN# between ourselves and our past lives.  One instant\r\nhad altered the whole conditions of our existence.",
    "It was at such a moment that I learned the stuff of which my three\r\ncomrades were composed.  They were grave, it is true, and thoughtful,\r\nbut of an #JJ# #NN#.  For the moment we could only sit among\r\nthe bushes in patience and wait the coming of Zambo.  Presently his\r\nhonest black face topped the rocks and his #JJ# figure emerged\r\nupon the top of the pinnacle.",
    "\"What I do now?\" he cried.  \"You tell me and I do it.\"",
    "It was a question which it was easier to ask than to answer.  One thing\r\nonly was clear.  He was our one trusty link with the outside world.  On\r\nno account must he leave us.",
    "\"No no!\" he cried.  \"I not leave you.  Whatever come, you always find\r\nme here.  But no able to keep Indians.  #RB# they say too much\r\nCurupuri live on this place, and they go home.  Now you leave them me\r\nno able to keep them.\"",
    "It was a fact that our Indians had shown in many ways of late that they\r\nwere weary of their journey and anxious to return.  We realized that\r\nZambo spoke the truth, and that it would be impossible for him to keep\r\nthem.",
    "\"Make them wait till to-morrow, Zambo,\" I shouted; \"then I can send\r\nletter back by them.\"",
    "\"Very good, #NN#! I promise they wait till to-morrow,\" said the negro.\r\n\"But what I do for you now?\"",
    "There was plenty for him to do, and admirably the faithful fellow did\r\nit.  First of all, under our directions, he undid the rope from the\r\n#NN# and threw one end of it across to us.  It was not thicker\r\nthan a #NN#, but it was of great strength, and though we could\r\nnot make a bridge of it, we might well find it invaluable if we had any\r\nclimbing to do.  He then fastened his end of the rope to the #NN# of\r\nsupplies which had been carried up, and we were able to drag it across.\r\nThis gave us the means of life for at least a week, even if we found\r\nnothing else.  Finally he descended and carried up two other #NNS# of\r\nmixed #NN# box of ammunition and a number of other things, all of\r\nwhich we got across by throwing our rope to him and #VBG# it back.\r\nIt was evening when he at last climbed down, with a final assurance\r\nthat he would keep the Indians till next morning.",
    "And so it is that I have spent nearly the whole of this our first night\r\nupon the plateau writing up our experiences by the light of a single\r\n#NN#.",
    "We supped and #VBD# at the very edge of the cliff, #VBG# our\r\n#NN# with two bottles of #NNS# which were in one of the cases.\r\nIt is vital to us to find water, but I think even Lord John himself had\r\nhad adventures enough for one day, and none of us felt inclined to make\r\nthe first push into the unknown.  We #VBD# to light a fire or to make\r\nany #JJ# sound.",
    "To-morrow (or to-day, rather, for it is already dawn as I write) we\r\nshall make our first venture into this strange land.  When I shall be\r\nable to write #NN# if I ever shall write #NN# know not.\r\nMeanwhile, I can see that the Indians are still in their place, and I\r\nam sure that the faithful Zambo will be here presently to get my\r\nletter.  I only trust that it will come to hand.",
    "P.S.#NN# more I think the more desperate does our position seem.  I\r\nsee no possible hope of our return.  If there were a high tree near the\r\nedge of the plateau we might drop a return bridge across, but there is\r\nnone within fifty yards.  Our #VBN# strength could not carry a trunk\r\nwhich would serve our purpose.  The rope, of course, is far too short\r\nthat we could descend by it.  No, our position is #NN#!",
    "                            CHAPTER X",
    "            \"The most Wonderful Things have #VBD#\"",
    "The most wonderful things have happened and are continually #VBG#\r\nto us.  All the paper that I possess consists of five old #NNS#\r\nand a lot of scraps, and I have only the one stylographic pencil; but\r\nso long as I can move my hand I will continue to set down our\r\nexperiences and #NNS#, for, since we are the only men of the\r\nwhole human race to see such things, it is of enormous importance that\r\nI should record them #NN# they are fresh in my memory and before that\r\nfate which seems to be constantly impending does actually #VB# us.\r\nWhether Zambo can at last take these letters to the river, or whether I\r\nshall myself in some #JJ# way carry them back with me, or,\r\nfinally, whether some #JJ# explorer, coming upon our tracks with the\r\nadvantage, perhaps, of a #VBN# #NN#, should find this bundle\r\nof #NN#, in any case I can see that what I am writing is destined\r\nto #NN# as a #JJ# of true adventure.",
    "On the morning after our being trapped upon the plateau by the\r\nvillainous Gomez we began a new stage in our experiences.  The first\r\nincident in it was not such as to give me a very favorable opinion of\r\nthe place to which we had wandered.  As I roused myself from a short\r\n#NN# after day had #VBD#, my eyes fell upon a most singular appearance\r\nupon my own leg.  My trouser had slipped up, exposing a few inches of\r\nmy skin above my #NN#.  On this there rested a large, #NN# #NN#.\r\n#VBN# at the sight, I leaned forward to pick it off, when, to my\r\nhorror, it burst between my finger and thumb, #VBG# blood in every\r\ndirection.  My cry of #NN# had brought the two professors to my side.",
    "\"Most interesting,\" said Summerlee, bending over my #NN#.  \"An enormous\r\n#NN#, as yet, I believe, #JJ#.\"",
    "\"The #NN# of our #NNS#,\" said Challenger in his #JJ#,\r\n#JJ# fashion.  \"We cannot do less than call it #NNS# #NN#.  The\r\nvery small #NN# of being bitten, my young friend, cannot, I am\r\nsure, #VB# with you as against the glorious privilege of having your\r\nname #VBN# in the #JJ# roll of zoology.  Unhappily you have\r\ncrushed this fine specimen at the moment of #NN#.\"",
    "\"#JJ# vermin!\" I cried.",
    "Professor Challenger raised his great eyebrows in protest, and placed a\r\nsoothing #NN# upon my shoulder.",
    "\"You should cultivate the scientific eye and the detached scientific\r\nmind,\" said he.  \"To a man of #JJ# #NN# like myself the\r\nblood-tick, with its #NN# #NN# and its #VBG# #NN#,\r\nis as beautiful a work of Nature as the peacock or, for that matter,\r\nthe #NN# #NNS#.  It pains me to hear you speak of it in so\r\n#NN# a fashion.  No doubt, with due #NN#, we can #VB#\r\nsome other specimen.\"",
    "\"There can be no doubt of that,\" said Summerlee, grimly, \"for one has\r\njust disappeared behind your #NN#.\"",
    "Challenger sprang into the air bellowing like a bull, and tore\r\n#RB# at his coat and #NN# to get them off.  Summerlee and I\r\nlaughed so that we could hardly help him.  At last we exposed that\r\nmonstrous #NN# (#NN# inches, by the #NN#'s #NN#).  His body\r\nwas all matted with black hair, out of which jungle we picked the\r\nwandering #VB# before it had bitten him.  But the bushes round were\r\nfull of the horrible #NNS#, and it was clear that we must #NN# our\r\ncamp.",
    "But first of all it was necessary to make our arrangements with the\r\nfaithful negro, who appeared presently on the pinnacle with a number of\r\ntins of #NN# and biscuits, which he tossed over to us.  Of the stores\r\nwhich remained below he was ordered to retain as much as would keep him\r\nfor two months.  The Indians were to have the #NN# as a reward for\r\ntheir services and as payment for taking our letters back to the\r\nAmazon.  Some hours later we saw them in single file far out upon the\r\nplain, each with a bundle on his head, making their way back along the\r\npath we had come.  Zambo occupied our little tent at the base of the\r\npinnacle, and there he remained, our one link with the world below.",
    "And now we had to decide upon our immediate movements.  We #VBD# our\r\nposition from among the #NN# bushes until we came to a small\r\nclearing thickly #VBN# by trees upon all sides.  There were some\r\nflat #NNS# of rock in the center, with an excellent well close by, and\r\nthere we sat in #RB# comfort while we made our first plans for the\r\n#NN# of this new country.  #NNP# were calling among the\r\n#RB# one with a peculiar #JJ# cry which was new to\r\n#NN# beyond these sounds there were no signs of life.",
    "Our first care was to make some sort of list of our own stores, so that\r\nwe might know what we had to rely upon.  What with the things we had\r\nourselves brought up and those which Zambo had sent across on the rope,\r\nwe were fairly well supplied.  Most important of all, in view of the\r\ndangers which might #VBP# us, we had our four rifles and one\r\nthousand three hundred #NNS#, also a shot-gun, but not more than a\r\nhundred and fifty #NN# pellet cartridges.  In the matter of\r\nprovisions we had enough to last for several weeks, with a #NN#\r\nof tobacco and a few scientific #NNS#, including a large #NN#\r\nand a good #NN#.  All these things we collected together in the\r\nclearing, and as a first precaution, we cut down with our hatchet and\r\nknives a number of #JJ# bushes, which we piled round in a circle some\r\nfifteen yards in #NN#.  This was to be our #NNS# for the\r\n#NN# place of refuge against sudden danger and the #NN# for\r\nour stores.  #NNP# Challenger, we called it.",
    "It was midday before we had made ourselves secure, but the heat was not\r\noppressive, and the general character of the plateau, both in its\r\ntemperature and in its vegetation, was almost #JJ#.  The beech,\r\nthe oak, and even the #NN# were to be found among the tangle of trees\r\nwhich girt us in.  One huge #NN# tree, #VBG# all the others, shot\r\nits great limbs and #NN# #NN# over the #NN# which we had\r\n#VBN#.  In its shade we continued our discussion, while Lord\r\nJohn, who had quickly taken command in the hour of action, gave us his\r\nviews.",
    "\"So long as neither man nor beast has seen or heard us, we are safe,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"From the time they know we are here our troubles begin.\r\nThere are no signs that they have found us out as yet.  So our game\r\nsurely is to lie low for a time and spy out the land.  We want to have\r\na good look at our neighbors before we get on #NN#' terms.\"",
    "\"But we must advance,\" I ventured to remark.",
    "\"By all means, sonny my boy!  We will advance.  But with common sense.\r\nWe must never go so far that we can't get back to our base.  Above all,\r\nwe must never, unless it is life or death, fire off our guns.\"",
    "\"But YOU fired yesterday,\" said Summerlee.",
    "\"Well, it couldn't be helped.  However, the wind was strong and blew\r\noutwards.  It is not likely that the sound could have traveled far into\r\nthe plateau.  By the way, what shall we call this place?  I suppose it\r\nis up to us to give it a name?\"",
    "There were several suggestions, more or less happy, but Challenger's\r\nwas final.",
    "\"It can only have one name,\" said he.  \"It is called after the pioneer\r\nwho discovered it.  It is Maple White #NNP#.\"",
    "Maple White Land it became, and so it is named in that chart which has\r\nbecome my special task.  So it will, I trust, appear in the #NNS# of\r\nthe future.",
    "The peaceful #NN# of Maple White Land was the pressing subject\r\nbefore us.  We had the evidence of our own eyes that the place was\r\n#VBN# by some unknown creatures, and there was that of Maple\r\nWhite's sketch-book to show that more dreadful and more dangerous\r\nmonsters might still appear.  That there might also prove to be human\r\noccupants and that they were of a malevolent character was suggested by\r\nthe skeleton impaled upon the bamboos, which could not have got there\r\nhad it not been dropped from above.  Our situation, #VBN# without\r\npossibility of escape in such a land, was clearly full of danger, and\r\nour reasons #VBN# every measure of caution which Lord John's\r\nexperience could suggest.  Yet it was surely impossible that we should\r\nhalt on the edge of this world of mystery when our very souls were\r\n#VBG# with impatience to push forward and to #VB# the heart from it.",
    "We therefore blocked the entrance to our #NN# by #VBG# it up with\r\nseveral thorny bushes, and left our camp with the stores entirely\r\nsurrounded by this #VBG# hedge.  We then slowly and #RB# set\r\nforth into the unknown, following the course of the little stream which\r\nflowed from our spring, as it should always serve us as a guide on our\r\nreturn.",
    "Hardly had we started when we came across signs that there were indeed\r\nwonders awaiting us.  After a few hundred yards of thick forest,\r\ncontaining many trees which were quite unknown to me, but which\r\nSummerlee, who was the #NN# of the party, recognized as forms of\r\n#NN# and of #NNS# plants which have long passed away in the\r\nworld below, we entered a region where the stream #VBD# out and\r\nformed a considerable bog.  High reeds of a peculiar type grew thickly\r\nbefore us, which were pronounced to be #NN#, or #NN#'#NN#,\r\nwith tree-ferns scattered #IN# them, all of them swaying in a #JJ#\r\nwind.  Suddenly Lord John, who was walking first, halted with #VBN#\r\nhand.",
    "\"Look at this!\" said he.  \"By George, this must be the trail of the\r\nfather of all birds!\"",
    "An enormous #VBN# track was #VBN# in the soft mud before us.\r\nThe creature, whatever it was, had crossed the swamp and had passed on\r\ninto the forest.  We all #VBN# to examine that monstrous #NN#.  If\r\nit were indeed a #NN# what animal could leave such a mark?#NNS#\r\nfoot was so much larger than an #JJ#'s that its height upon the same\r\nscale must be enormous.  Lord John looked eagerly round him and slipped\r\ntwo cartridges into his #NN#.",
    "\"I'll stake my good name as a #NN#,\" said he, \"that the track is a\r\nfresh one.  The creature has not passed ten minutes.  Look how the\r\nwater is still #VBG# into that deeper print!  By Jove!  See, here is\r\nthe mark of a little one!\"",
    "Sure enough, smaller tracks of the same general form were running\r\nparallel to the large ones.",
    "\"But what do you make of this?\" cried Professor Summerlee,\r\ntriumphantly, pointing to what looked like the huge print of a\r\n#VBN# human hand #VBG# among the three-toed marks.",
    "\"Wealden!\" cried Challenger, in an ecstasy.  \"I've seen them in the\r\nWealden clay.  It is a creature walking #VB# upon three-toed feet, and\r\noccasionally putting one of its five-fingered #NNS# upon the ground.\r\nNot a bird, my dear #NN# a bird.\"",
    "\"A beast?\"",
    "\"No; a #NN# #NN#.  Nothing else could have left such a track.\r\nThey puzzled a worthy Sussex doctor some ninety years ago; but who in\r\nthe world could have #NN# have seen a sight like that?\"",
    "His words died away into a whisper, and we all #NN# in motionless\r\namazement.  Following the tracks, we had left the morass and passed\r\nthrough a screen of brushwood and trees.  Beyond was an open #NN#, and\r\nin this were five of the most extraordinary creatures that I have ever\r\nseen.  Crouching down among the bushes, we observed them at our leisure.",
    "There were, as I say, five of them, two being #NNS# and three young\r\nones.  In size they were enormous.  Even the babies were as big as\r\nelephants, while the two large ones were far beyond all creatures I\r\nhave ever seen.  They had #VBN# skin, which was #VBN# like a\r\nlizard's and #VBD# where the sun shone upon it.  All five were\r\nsitting up, #VBG# themselves upon their broad, powerful #NNS# and\r\ntheir huge three-toed #NN#, while with their small five-fingered\r\n#NN# they pulled down the branches upon which they #VBN#.  I do\r\nnot know that I can bring their appearance home to you better than by\r\nsaying that they looked like monstrous #NNS#, twenty feet in\r\nlength, and with skins like black crocodiles.",
    "I do not know how long we #VBD# motionless gazing at this marvelous\r\nspectacle.  A strong wind blew towards us and we were well concealed,\r\nso there was no chance of discovery.  From time to time the little ones\r\nplayed round their #NNS# in unwieldy #NNS#, the great beasts\r\n#VBG# into the air and falling with dull #NNS# upon the earth.  The\r\nstrength of the parents seemed to be #JJ#, for one of them, having\r\nsome difficulty in reaching a bunch of foliage which grew upon a\r\n#VBN# tree, put his #NNS# round the trunk and tore it\r\ndown as if it had been a #VBG#.  The action seemed, as I thought, to\r\nshow not only the great development of its muscles, but also the small\r\none of its brain, for the whole weight came #VBG# down upon the top\r\nof it, and it uttered a series of shrill #NNS# to show that, big as it\r\nwas, there was a limit to what it could endure.  The incident made it\r\nthink, apparently, that the #NN# was dangerous, for it slowly\r\nlurched off through the wood, followed by its #NN# and its three\r\nenormous #NNS#.  We saw the #VBG# #NN# gleam of their skins\r\nbetween the tree-trunks, and their heads #JJ# high above the\r\n#NN#.  Then they vanished from our sight.",
    "I looked at my comrades.  Lord John was standing at gaze with his\r\nfinger on the #NN# of his elephant-gun, his eager hunter's soul\r\nshining from his fierce eyes.  What would he not give for one such head\r\nto place between the two crossed #NNS# above the mantelpiece in his\r\n#NN# at the Albany!  And yet his reason held him in, for all our\r\nexploration of the wonders of this unknown land depended upon our\r\npresence being concealed from its inhabitants.  The two professors were\r\nin silent ecstasy.  In their excitement they had #RB# seized\r\neach other by the hand, and stood like two little children in the\r\npresence of a #NN#, Challenger's cheeks bunched up into a #NN#\r\nsmile, and Summerlee's sardonic face #VBG# for the moment into\r\nwonder and reverence.",
    "\"#NN# #NNS#!\" he cried at last.  \"What will they say in England of\r\nthis?\"",
    "\"My dear Summerlee, I will tell you with great confidence exactly what\r\nthey will say in England,\" said Challenger.  \"They will say that you\r\nare an infernal liar and a scientific charlatan, exactly as you and\r\nothers said of me.\"",
    "\"In the face of photographs?\"",
    "\"#VBN#, Summerlee!  #RB# #VBN#!\"",
    "\"In the face of specimens?\"",
    "\"Ah, there we may have them!  Malone and his #JJ# #NNP# Street #NN#\r\nmay be all #VBG# our #VBZ# yet.  August the #NN# day\r\nwe saw five live #NNS# in a glade of Maple White Land.  Put it\r\ndown in your diary, my young friend, and send it to your rag.\"",
    "\"And be ready to get the #NN# of the editorial #NN# in return,\" said\r\nLord John.  \"Things look a bit different from the latitude of London,\r\nyoung fellah my lad.  There's many a man who never #VBZ# his\r\nadventures, for he can't hope to be believed.  Who's to blame them?\r\nFor this will seem a bit of a dream to ourselves in a month or two.\r\n#WP# did you say they were?\"",
    "\"#NNS#,\" said Summerlee.  \"You'll find their #NNS# all over\r\nthe #NNP# #NNS#, in #NNP#, and in Sussex.  The South of England was\r\nalive with them when there was plenty of good #JJ# #NN# to keep\r\nthem going.  #NNS# have changed, and the beasts died.  Here it\r\nseems that the conditions have not changed, and the beasts have lived.\"",
    "\"If ever we get out of this alive, I must have a head with me,\" said\r\nLord John.  \"Lord, how some of that #NN# crowd would turn\r\na beautiful #JJ# if they saw it!  I don't know what you #NNS#\r\nthink, but it strikes me that we are on mighty thin ice all this time.\"",
    "I had the same feeling of mystery and danger around us.  In the gloom\r\nof the trees there seemed a constant menace and as we looked up into\r\ntheir shadowy foliage vague #NNS# crept into one's heart.  It is true\r\nthat these monstrous creatures which we had seen were lumbering,\r\ninoffensive #NNS# which were unlikely to hurt anyone, but in this\r\nworld of wonders what other #NNS# might there not #NN# fierce,\r\nactive horrors ready to #VB# upon us from their #NN# among the rocks\r\nor brushwood?  I knew little of prehistoric life, but I had a clear\r\n#NN# of one book which I had read in which it spoke of creatures\r\nwho would live upon our #NNS# and #NNS# as a cat lives upon #NNS#.\r\nWhat if these also were to be found in the woods of Maple White Land!",
    "It was destined that on this very #NN# first in the new\r\n#NN# were to find out what strange #NNS# lay around us.  It\r\nwas a loathsome adventure, and one of which I hate to think.  If, as\r\nLord John said, the glade of the iguanodons will remain with us as a\r\ndream, then surely the swamp of the #NNS# will forever be our\r\nnightmare.  Let me set down exactly what occurred.",
    "We passed very slowly through the woods, partly because Lord Roxton\r\nacted as #NN# before he would let us advance, and partly because at\r\nevery second step one or other of our professors would #VB#, with a cry\r\nof wonder, before some #NN# or insect which presented him with a new\r\ntype.  We may have traveled two or three miles in all, keeping to the\r\nright of the line of the stream, when we came upon a considerable\r\nopening in the trees.  A belt of brushwood led up to a tangle of\r\n#NN# whole plateau was strewn with #NNS#.  We were walking\r\nslowly towards these rocks, among bushes which reached over our waists,\r\nwhen we became aware of a strange low #VBG# and whistling sound,\r\nwhich filled the air with a constant #VBP# and appeared to come from\r\nsome spot immediately before us.  Lord John held up his hand as a\r\nsignal for us to stop, and he made his way swiftly, stooping and\r\nrunning, to the line of rocks.  We saw him #NN# over them and give a\r\ngesture of amazement.  Then he stood staring as if #VBG# us, so\r\nutterly #VBN# was he by what he saw.  Finally he waved us to come\r\non, holding up his hand as a signal for caution.  His whole bearing\r\nmade me feel that something wonderful but dangerous lay before us.",
    "Creeping to his side, we looked over the rocks.  The place into which\r\nwe gazed was a #NN#, and may, in the early days, have been one of the\r\nsmaller volcanic #NNS# of the plateau.  It was #JJ# and at\r\nthe bottom, some hundreds of yards from where we lay, were #NNS# of\r\n#VBN#, stagnant water, fringed with #NN#.  It was a weird\r\nplace in itself, but its occupants made it seem like a scene from the\r\n#NN# #NNS# of #NNP#.  The place was a rookery of pterodactyls.\r\nThere were hundreds of them #VBD# within view.  All the bottom\r\narea round the #NN# was alive with their young ones, and with\r\nhideous #NNS# brooding upon their leathery, yellowish #NNS#.  From\r\nthis crawling flapping mass of #JJ# #JJ# life came the shocking\r\nclamor which filled the air and the #NN#, horrible, #NN# #NN#\r\nwhich turned us sick.  But above, perched each upon its own stone,\r\ntall, gray, and withered, more like dead and dried specimens than\r\nactual living creatures, sat the horrible #NNS#, absolutely motionless\r\nsave for the rolling of their red eyes or an occasional snap of their\r\n#NN# #NNS# as a #RB# went past them.  Their huge, membranous\r\nwings were closed by #VBG# their #NNS#, so that they sat like\r\ngigantic old women, wrapped in hideous #VBN# #NNS#, and with\r\ntheir ferocious heads protruding above them.  #JJ# and small, not less\r\nthan a thousand of these filthy creatures lay in the hollow before us.",
    "Our professors would #RB# have stayed there all day, so entranced\r\nwere they by this opportunity of studying the life of a prehistoric\r\nage.  They pointed out the fish and dead birds lying about among the\r\nrocks as #VBG# the nature of the food of these creatures, and I heard\r\nthem #VBG# each other on having cleared up the point why the\r\nbones of this flying #NN# are found in such great #NNS# in certain\r\n#JJ# #NNS#, as in the #NNP# #NN#, since it was now\r\nseen that, like #NNS#, they lived in gregarious fashion.",
    "Finally, however, Challenger, bent upon proving some point which\r\nSummerlee had #VBN#, thrust his head over the rock and nearly\r\nbrought #NN# upon us all.  In an instant the nearest male gave a\r\nshrill, whistling cry, and #VBD# its #NN# #NN# of leathery\r\nwings as it #VBD# up into the air.  The #NNS# and young ones huddled\r\ntogether beside the water, while the whole circle of #NNS# rose one\r\nafter the other and #VBD# off into the sky.  It was a wonderful sight\r\nto see at least a hundred creatures of such enormous size and hideous\r\nappearance all #VBG# like #NNS# with swift, #VBG# #NN#\r\nabove us; but soon we realized that it was not one on which we could\r\nafford to linger.  At first the great brutes flew round in a huge ring,\r\nas if to make sure what the exact extent of the danger might be.  Then,\r\nthe flight grew lower and the circle #JJR#, until they were whizzing\r\nround and round us, the dry, rustling flap of their huge slate-colored\r\nwings filling the air with a volume of sound that made me think of\r\n#NN# #NN# upon a race day.",
    "\"Make for the wood and keep together,\" cried Lord John, #VBG# his\r\nrifle.  \"The brutes mean mischief.\"",
    "The moment we attempted to retreat the circle closed in upon us, until\r\nthe #NNS# of the wings of those nearest to us nearly touched our faces.\r\nWe beat at them with the #NNS# of our guns, but there was nothing\r\nsolid or #JJ# to strike.  Then suddenly out of the whizzing,\r\nslate-colored circle a long neck shot out, and a fierce beak made a\r\nthrust at us.  Another and another #VBN#.  Summerlee gave a cry and\r\nput his hand to his face, from which the blood was #VBG#.  I felt a\r\n#NN# at the back of my neck, and turned #JJ# with the shock.\r\nChallenger fell, and as I stooped to pick him up I was again struck\r\nfrom behind and dropped on the top of him.  At the same instant I heard\r\nthe crash of Lord John's elephant-gun, and, looking up, saw one of the\r\ncreatures with a broken wing struggling upon the ground, #VBG# and\r\n#VBG# at us with a #VBN# beak and #NN#, #VBN# eyes,\r\nlike some devil in a #JJ# picture.  Its comrades had flown higher\r\nat the sudden sound, and were circling above our heads.",
    "\"Now,\" cried Lord John, \"now for our lives!\"",
    "We staggered through the brushwood, and even as we reached the trees\r\nthe #NNS# were on us again.  Summerlee was knocked down, but we tore\r\nhim up and rushed among the trunks.  Once there we were safe, for those\r\nhuge wings had no space for their sweep beneath the branches.  As we\r\nlimped #RB#, sadly #VBN# and #JJ#, we saw them for a long\r\ntime flying at a great height against the deep blue sky above our\r\nheads, #VBG# round and round, no bigger than #NNS#, with their\r\neyes no doubt still following our progress.  At last, however, as we\r\nreached the thicker woods they gave up the chase, and we saw them no\r\nmore.",
    "\"A most interesting and #JJ# experience,\" said Challenger, as we\r\nhalted beside the brook and he bathed a #JJ# knee.  \"We are\r\n#RB# well informed, Summerlee, as to the habits of the enraged\r\npterodactyl.\"",
    "Summerlee was wiping the blood from a cut in his forehead, while I was\r\n#VBG# up a nasty stab in the #NN# of the neck.  Lord John had the\r\nshoulder of his coat torn away, but the creature's teeth had only\r\n#VBD# the #NN#.",
    "\"It is worth #VBG#,\" Challenger continued, \"that our young friend has\r\nreceived an #VBN# stab, while Lord John's coat could only have been\r\ntorn by a #NN#.  In my own case, I was beaten about the head by their\r\nwings, so we have had a remarkable exhibition of their various methods\r\nof offence.\"",
    "\"It has been touch and go for our lives,\" said Lord John, gravely, \"and\r\nI could not think of a more rotten sort of death than to be #VBN# by\r\nsuch filthy vermin.  I was sorry to fire my rifle, but, by Jove! there\r\nwas no great choice.\"",
    "\"We should not be here if you hadn't,\" said I, with conviction.",
    "\"It may do no harm,\" said he.  \"Among these woods there must be many\r\nloud #NNS# from #VBG# or falling trees which would be just like\r\nthe sound of a gun.  But now, if you are of my opinion, we have had\r\n#NNS# enough for one day, and had best get back to the #JJ# box\r\nat the camp for some carbolic.  Who knows what #NN# these beasts may\r\nhave in their hideous jaws?\"",
    "But surely no men ever had just such a day since the world began.  Some\r\nfresh surprise was ever in store for us.  When, following the course of\r\nour brook, we at last reached our glade and saw the thorny #NN# of\r\nour camp, we thought that our adventures were at an end.  But we had\r\nsomething more to think of before we could rest.  The gate of Fort\r\nChallenger had been untouched, the walls were unbroken, and yet it had\r\nbeen visited by some strange and powerful creature in our absence.  No\r\n#NN# showed a trace of its nature, and only the overhanging branch\r\nof the enormous #NN# tree suggested how it might have come and gone;\r\nbut of its malevolent strength there was ample evidence in the\r\ncondition of our stores.  They were strewn at #JJ# all over the\r\nground, and one tin of meat had been crushed into pieces so as to\r\n#VB# the contents.  A case of cartridges had been shattered into\r\nmatchwood, and one of the #NN# shells lay #JJ# into pieces beside\r\nit.  Again the feeling of vague horror came upon our souls, and we\r\ngazed round with frightened eyes at the dark shadows which lay around\r\nus, in all of which some fearsome shape might be lurking.  How good it\r\nwas when we were hailed by the voice of Zambo, and, going to the edge\r\nof the plateau, saw him sitting grinning at us upon the top of the\r\nopposite pinnacle.",
    "\"All well, #NNP# Challenger, all well!\" he cried.  \"#PRP# stay here.  No\r\nfear.  You always find me when you want.\"",
    "His honest black face, and the immense view before us, which carried us\r\nhalf-way back to the #JJ# of the Amazon, helped us to remember that\r\nwe really were upon this earth in the #JJ# #NN#, and had not by\r\nsome magic been conveyed to some #JJ# planet in its earliest and #JJS#\r\nstate.  How difficult it was to realize that the violet line upon the\r\nfar horizon was well advanced to that great river upon which huge\r\n#NNS# ran, and folk talked of the small affairs of life, while we,\r\n#VBD# among the creatures of a #JJ# age, could but gaze towards it\r\nand #VB# for all that it meant!",
    "One other memory remains with me of this wonderful day, and with it I\r\nwill close this letter.  The two professors, their #NNS# aggravated\r\nno doubt by their #NNS#, had fallen out as to whether our #NNS#\r\nwere of the #NNS# #NNS# or dimorphodon, and high words had\r\n#VBD#.  To avoid their #VBG# I moved some little way apart, and\r\nwas seated smoking upon the trunk of a fallen tree, when Lord John\r\nstrolled over in my direction.",
    "\"I say, Malone,\" said he, \"do you remember that place where those\r\nbeasts were?\"",
    "\"Very clearly.\"",
    "\"A sort of volcanic pit, was it not?\"",
    "\"Exactly,\" said I.",
    "\"Did you notice the soil?\"",
    "\"#NNS#.\"",
    "\"But round the #NN# the reeds were?\"",
    "\"It was a #JJ# soil.  It looked like clay.\"",
    "\"Exactly.  A volcanic #NN# full of blue clay.\"",
    "\"What of that?\" I asked.",
    "\"Oh, nothing, nothing,\" said he, and strolled back to where the voices\r\nof the #VBG# men of science rose in a prolonged #NN#, the high,\r\n#JJ# note of Summerlee rising and falling to the #JJ# #NN# of\r\nChallenger.  I should have thought no more of Lord John's remark were\r\nit not that once again that night I heard him mutter to himself:  \"#NNP#\r\n#NN# in a volcanic tube!\" They were the last words I heard before\r\nI dropped into an exhausted sleep.",
    "                            CHAPTER XI",
    "                    \"For once I was the #NNP#\"",
    "Lord John Roxton was right when he thought that some specially toxic\r\nquality might lie in the bite of the horrible creatures which had\r\nattacked us.  On the morning after our first adventure upon the\r\nplateau, both Summerlee and I were in great pain and fever, while\r\nChallenger's knee was so #VBN# that he could hardly limp.  We kept to\r\nour camp all day, therefore, Lord John #VBG# himself, with such help\r\nas we could give him, in raising the height and thickness of the thorny\r\nwalls which were our only #NN#.  I remember that during the whole\r\nlong day I was haunted by the feeling that we were closely observed,\r\nthough by whom or whence I could give no #NN#.",
    "So strong was the impression that I told Professor Challenger of it,\r\nwho put it down to the #JJ# excitement caused by my fever.  Again\r\nand again I glanced round swiftly, with the conviction that I was about\r\nto see something, but only to meet the dark tangle of our hedge or the\r\nsolemn and #JJ# gloom of the great trees which arched above our\r\nheads.  And yet the feeling grew ever stronger in my own mind that\r\nsomething observant and something malevolent was at our very elbow.  I\r\nthought of the Indian superstition of the #NN# dreadful,\r\nlurking spirit of the #NN# I could have imagined that his\r\nterrible presence haunted those who had invaded his most remote and\r\n#JJ# retreat.",
    "That night (our third in Maple White Land) we had an experience which\r\nleft a fearful impression upon our minds, and made us #JJ# that\r\nLord John had worked so hard in making our retreat #JJ#.  We\r\nwere all sleeping round our dying fire when we were #NN#,\r\nrather, I should say, shot out of our #NN# a succession of the\r\nmost frightful cries and #NNS# to which I have ever listened.  I know\r\nno sound to which I could compare this amazing tumult, which seemed to\r\ncome from some spot within a few hundred yards of our camp.  It was as\r\n#JJ# as any whistle of a #NN#; but #IN# the\r\nwhistle is a clear, #JJ#, #NN# sound, this was far deeper\r\nin volume and #JJ# with the #JJ# strain of agony and horror.\r\nWe clapped our hands to our ears to shut out that nerve-shaking appeal.\r\nA cold sweat broke out over my body, and my heart turned sick at the\r\nmisery of it.  All the #NNS# of #VBN# life, all its stupendous\r\n#NN# of high heaven, its innumerable #NNS#, seemed to be\r\ncentered and condensed into that one dreadful, #VBD# cry.  And then,\r\nunder this #JJ#, ringing sound there was another, more\r\n#JJ#, a low, #VBN# laugh, a #VBG#, #JJ# #NN# of\r\n#NN# which formed a grotesque #NN# to the shriek with\r\nwhich it was #JJ#.  For three or four minutes on end the fearsome\r\nduet continued, while all the foliage #VBN# with the rising of\r\nstartled birds.  Then it shut off as suddenly as it began.  For a long\r\ntime we sat in horrified silence.  Then Lord John threw a bundle of\r\n#NNS# upon the fire, and their red glare lit up the intent faces of my\r\ncompanions and #VBD# over the great #NNS# above our heads.",
    "\"What was it?\" I whispered.",
    "\"We shall know in the morning,\" said Lord John.  \"It  was close to\r\n#NN# farther than the glade.\"",
    "\"We have been #JJ# to #VB# a prehistoric tragedy, the sort of\r\ndrama which occurred among the reeds upon the #NN# of some Jurassic\r\n#NN#, when the greater dragon #VBN# the lesser among the slime,\"\r\nsaid Challenger, with more solemnity than I had ever heard in his\r\nvoice.  \"It was surely well for man that he came late in the order of\r\ncreation.  There were powers abroad in earlier days which no courage\r\nand no mechanism of his could have met.  What could his #VBG#, his\r\n#NN#, or his arrow avail him against such forces as have been\r\nloose to-night?  Even with a modern rifle it would be all odds on the\r\nmonster.\"",
    "\"I think I should back my little friend,\" said Lord John, #VBG# his\r\n#NNP#.  \"But the beast would certainly have a good sporting chance.\"",
    "Summerlee raised his hand.",
    "\"#NN#!\" he cried.  \"Surely I hear something?\"",
    "From the utter silence there emerged a deep, #JJ# #NN#.  It was\r\nthe #NN# of some #NN# rhythm of soft but heavy #NNS# placed\r\ncautiously upon the ground.  It stole slowly round the camp, and then\r\nhalted near our #NN#.  There was a low, #JJ# rise and #NN#\r\nbreathing of the creature.  Only our feeble #NN# separated us from\r\nthis horror of the night.  Each of us had seized his rifle, and Lord\r\nJohn had pulled out a small bush to make an #NN# in the hedge.",
    "\"By George!\" he whispered.  \"I think I can see it!\"",
    "I stooped and peered over his shoulder through the gap.  Yes, I could\r\nsee it, too.  In the deep shadow of the tree there was a deeper shadow\r\nyet, black, #NN#, #NN# crouching form full of savage #NN# and\r\nmenace.  It was no higher than a horse, but the dim outline suggested\r\nvast #NN# and strength.  That #VBG# #NN#, as regular and #VBN#\r\nas the exhaust of an engine, spoke of a monstrous organism.  Once, as\r\nit moved, I thought I saw the glint of two terrible, #JJ# eyes.\r\nThere was an uneasy rustling, as if it were crawling slowly forward.",
    "\"I believe it is going to spring!\" said I, #VBG# my rifle.",
    "\"Don't fire!  Don't fire!\" whispered Lord John.  \"The crash of a gun in\r\nthis silent night would be heard for miles.  Keep it as a last card.\"",
    "\"If it gets over the hedge we're done,\" said Summerlee, and his voice\r\n#VBD# into a nervous laugh as he spoke.",
    "\"No, it must not get over,\" cried Lord John; \"but hold your fire to the\r\nlast.  Perhaps I can make something of the fellow.  I'll chance it,\r\nanyhow.\"",
    "It was as brave an act as ever I saw a man do.  He stooped to the fire,\r\npicked up a blazing branch, and slipped in an instant through a\r\n#NN# which he had made in our gateway.  The thing moved forward\r\nwith a dreadful snarl.  Lord John never hesitated, but, running towards\r\nit with a quick, light step, he dashed the flaming wood into the\r\nbrute's face.  For one moment I had a vision of a horrible #NN# like a\r\ngiant #NN#'s, of a #JJ#, #NNS# skin, and of a loose mouth all\r\n#VBN# with fresh blood.  The next, there was a crash in the\r\n#NN# and our dreadful visitor was gone.",
    "\"I thought he wouldn't face the fire,\" said Lord John, laughing, as he\r\ncame back and threw his branch among the #NNS#.",
    "\"You should not have taken such a risk!\" we all #VBN#.",
    "\"There was nothin' else to be done.  If he had got among us we should\r\nhave shot each other in #NN#' to down him.  On the other hand, if we\r\nhad fired through the hedge and wounded him he would soon have been on\r\nthe top of #NN# say nothin' of giving ourselves away.  On the whole,\r\nI think that we are #RB# well out of it.  What was he, then?\"",
    "Our learned men looked at each other with some #NN#.",
    "\"Personally, I am unable to #VB# the creature with any #NN#,\"\r\nsaid Summerlee, lighting his pipe from the fire.",
    "\"In refusing to commit yourself you are but showing a proper scientific\r\nreserve,\" said Challenger, with massive #NN#.  \"I am not\r\nmyself prepared to go farther than to say in general terms that we have\r\nalmost certainly been in contact to-night with some form of #JJ#\r\ndinosaur.  I have already expressed my #NN# that something of\r\nthe sort might exist upon this plateau.\"",
    "\"We have to bear in mind,\" remarked Summerlee, \"that there are many\r\nprehistoric forms which have never come down to us.  It would be rash\r\nto suppose that we can give a name to all that we are likely to meet.\"",
    "\"Exactly.  A rough #NN# may be the best that we can attempt.\r\nTo-morrow some further evidence may help us to an #NN#.\r\n#RB# we can only renew our interrupted slumbers.\"",
    "\"But not without a #NN#,\" said Lord John, with #NN#.  \"We can't\r\nafford to take chances in a country like this.  #JJ# #VBZ# in the\r\nfuture, for each of us.\"",
    "\"Then I'll just #VB# my pipe in starting the first one,\" said\r\nProfessor Summerlee; and from that time onwards we never trusted\r\nourselves again without a watchman.",
    "In the morning it was not long before we discovered the #NN# of the\r\nhideous uproar which had aroused us in the night.  The #NN# glade\r\nwas the scene of a horrible #NN#.  From the pools of blood and the\r\nenormous #NNS# of flesh scattered in every direction over the green\r\n#NN# we imagined at first that a number of animals had been killed,\r\nbut on examining the remains more closely we discovered that all this\r\n#NN# came from one of these unwieldy monsters, which had been\r\nliterally torn to pieces by some creature not larger, perhaps, but far\r\nmore ferocious, than itself.",
    "Our two professors sat in absorbed argument, examining piece after\r\npiece, which showed the marks of savage teeth and of enormous #NNS#.",
    "\"Our judgment must still be in #NN#,\" said Professor Challenger,\r\nwith a huge #NN# of #VBN# flesh across his knee.  \"The\r\nindications would be #JJ# with the presence of a #JJ#\r\ntiger, such as are still found among the #NN# of our #NNS#; but\r\nthe creature actually seen was undoubtedly of a larger and more\r\nreptilian character.  Personally, I should #VB# for #NN#.\"",
    "\"Or #NN#,\" said Summerlee.",
    "\"Exactly.  Any one of the larger carnivorous #NNS# would meet the\r\ncase.  Among them are to be found all the most terrible types of animal\r\nlife that have ever cursed the earth or #VBN# a #NN#.\" He laughed\r\n#RB# at his own conceit, for, though he had little sense of\r\nhumor, the #JJS# #NN# from his own lips moved him always to\r\n#VBZ# of appreciation.",
    "\"The less noise the better,\" said Lord Roxton, #RB#.  \"We don't know\r\nwho or what may be near us.  If this fellah comes back for his\r\nbreakfast and #VBZ# us here we won't have so much to laugh at.  By\r\nthe way, what is this mark upon the iguanodon's #VB#?\"",
    "On the dull, #RB#, slate-colored skin somewhere above the shoulder,\r\nthere was a singular black circle of some substance which looked like\r\n#NN#.  None of us could suggest what it meant, though Summerlee was\r\nof opinion that he had seen something similar upon one of the young\r\nones two days before.  Challenger said nothing, but looked pompous and\r\npuffy, as if he could if he would, so that finally Lord John asked his\r\nopinion direct.",
    "\"If your #NN# will #RB# permit me to open my mouth, I shall\r\nbe happy to express my #NNS#,\" said he, with elaborate sarcasm.\r\n\"I am not in the habit of being taken to task in the fashion which\r\nseems to be #JJ# with your lordship.  I was not aware that it was\r\nnecessary to ask your permission before smiling at a harmless\r\npleasantry.\"",
    "It was not until he had received his apology that our touchy friend\r\nwould #VB# himself to be #VBN#.  When at last his ruffled feelings\r\nwere at ease, he addressed us at some length from his seat upon a\r\nfallen tree, speaking, as his habit was, as if he were #VBG# most\r\nprecious information to a class of a thousand.",
    "\"With regard to the #VBG#,\" said he, \"I am inclined to agree with my\r\nfriend and colleague, Professor Summerlee, that the #NNS# are from\r\nasphalt.  As this plateau is, in its very nature, highly volcanic, and\r\nas asphalt is a substance which one associates with #NN# forces, I\r\ncannot doubt that it exists in the free liquid state, and that the\r\ncreatures may have come in contact with it.  A much more important\r\nproblem is the question as to the existence of the carnivorous monster\r\nwhich has left its traces in this glade.  We know roughly that this\r\nplateau is not larger than an average English county.  Within this\r\nconfined space a certain number of creatures, #RB# types which have\r\npassed away in the world below, have lived together for innumerable\r\nyears.  Now, it is very clear to me that in so long a period one would\r\nhave expected that the carnivorous creatures, #VBG# #JJ#,\r\nwould have exhausted their food supply and have been compelled to\r\neither #NN# their #VBG# habits or die of #NN#.  This we see\r\nhas not been so.  We can only imagine, therefore, that the balance of\r\nNature is #VBN# by some check which limits the numbers of these\r\nferocious creatures.  One of the many interesting problems, therefore,\r\nwhich await our solution is to #VB# what that check may be and how\r\nit #VBZ#.  I venture to trust that we may have some future\r\nopportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs.\"",
    "\"And I venture to trust we may not,\" I observed.",
    "The Professor only raised his great eyebrows, as the #NN# #VBZ#\r\nthe irrelevant observation of the #JJ# boy.",
    "\"Perhaps Professor Summerlee may have an observation to make,\" he said,\r\nand the two savants ascended together into some rarefied scientific\r\natmosphere, where the possibilities of a #NN# of the #NN#\r\nwere #VBD# against the #NN# of the food supply as a check in the\r\nstruggle for existence.",
    "That morning we #VBN# out a small portion of the plateau, #VBG# the\r\nswamp of the pterodactyls, and keeping to the east of our brook instead\r\nof to the west.  In that direction the country was still thickly\r\n#JJ#, with so much undergrowth that our progress was very slow.",
    "I have dwelt up to now upon the terrors of Maple White Land; but there\r\nwas another side to the subject, for all that morning we wandered among\r\nlovely #RB#, as I observed, white or yellow in color, these\r\nbeing, as our professors explained, the primitive #NN#.  In\r\nmany places the ground was absolutely covered with them, and as we\r\nwalked #JJ# on that wonderful #VBG# carpet, the scent was\r\nalmost #JJ# in its sweetness and intensity.  The #RB# English\r\nbee #VBD# #RB# around us.  Many of the trees under which we\r\npassed had their branches bowed down with fruit, some of which were of\r\nfamiliar sorts, while other #NNS# were new.  By observing which of\r\nthem were #VBD# by the birds we avoided all danger of poison and added\r\na delicious variety to our food reserve.  In the jungle which we\r\ntraversed were numerous #NN# paths made by the wild beasts, and\r\nin the more marshy places we saw a profusion of strange footmarks,\r\nincluding many of the iguanodon.  Once in a #NN# we observed several\r\nof these great creatures #VBG#, and Lord John, with his glass, was\r\nable to report that they also were #VBD# with asphalt, though in a\r\ndifferent place to the one which we had examined in the morning.  What\r\nthis #NN# meant we could not imagine.",
    "We saw many small animals, such as #NNS#, a scaly ant-eater, and a\r\nwild #NN#, #NN# in color and with long curved #NNS#.  Once, through a\r\nbreak in the trees, we saw a clear shoulder of green hill some distance\r\naway, and across this a large dun-colored animal was traveling at a\r\nconsiderable pace.  It passed so swiftly that we were unable to say\r\nwhat it was; but if it were a deer, as was claimed by Lord John, it\r\nmust have been as large as those monstrous Irish #NNS# which are still\r\n#VBD# up from time to time in the #VBZ# of my native land.",
    "#RB# since the mysterious visit which had been paid to our camp we\r\nalways returned to it with some #NNS#.  However, on this occasion\r\nwe found everything in order.",
    "That evening we had a #JJ# discussion upon our present situation and\r\nfuture plans, which I must describe at some length, as it led to a new\r\ndeparture by which we were enabled to gain a more complete knowledge of\r\nMaple White Land than might have come in many weeks of exploring.  It\r\nwas Summerlee who opened the debate.  All day he had been querulous in\r\nmanner, and now some remark of Lord John's as to what we should do on\r\nthe #NN# brought all his bitterness to a head.",
    "\"What we ought to be doing to-day, to-morrow, and all the time,\" said\r\nhe, \"is finding some way out of the trap into which we have fallen.\r\nYou are all turning your brains towards getting into this country.  I\r\nsay that we should be scheming how to get out of it.\"",
    "\"I am surprised, sir,\" boomed Challenger, #VBG# his majestic beard,\r\n\"that any man of science should commit himself to so ignoble a\r\nsentiment.  You are in a land which #VBZ# such an #NN# to the\r\n#JJ# naturalist as none ever has since the world began, and you\r\nsuggest leaving it before we have acquired more than the most\r\nsuperficial knowledge of it or of its contents.  I expected better\r\nthings of you, Professor Summerlee.\"",
    "\"You must remember,\" said Summerlee, #RB#, \"that I have a large class\r\nin London who are at present at the mercy of an extremely inefficient\r\n#NN# #NNS#.  This makes my situation different from yours, Professor\r\nChallenger, since, so far as I know, you have never been #VBN# with\r\nany responsible #JJ# work.\"",
    "\"Quite so,\" said Challenger.  \"I have felt it to be a #NN# to\r\n#VB# a brain which is capable of the highest original research to any\r\nlesser object.  That is why I have sternly set my face against any\r\n#VBN# #JJ# appointment.\"",
    "\"For example?\" asked Summerlee, with a sneer; but Lord John hastened to\r\nchange the conversation.",
    "\"I must say,\" said he, \"that I think it would be a mighty poor thing to\r\ngo back to London before I know a great deal more of this place than I\r\ndo at present.\"",
    "\"I could never dare to walk into the back office of my paper and face\r\nold McArdle,\" said I.  (You will excuse the frankness of this report,\r\nwill you not, sir?)  \"He'd never #VB# me for leaving such\r\n#VBN# copy behind me.  Besides, so far as I can see it is not\r\nworth discussing, since we can't get down, even if we wanted.\"",
    "\"Our young friend makes up for many obvious mental #NN# by some\r\nmeasure of primitive common sense,\" remarked Challenger.  \"The\r\ninterests of his deplorable profession are immaterial to us; but, as he\r\n#VBZ#, we cannot get down in any case, so it is a waste of energy to\r\ndiscuss it.\"",
    "\"It is a waste of energy to do anything else,\" #VBD# Summerlee from\r\nbehind his pipe.  \"Let me remind you that we came here upon a perfectly\r\ndefinite mission, entrusted to us at the meeting of the Zoological\r\nInstitute in London.  That mission was to test the truth of Professor\r\nChallenger's statements.  Those statements, as I am bound to admit, we\r\nare now in a position to endorse.  Our #JJ# work is therefore\r\ndone.  As to the detail which remains to be worked out upon this\r\nplateau, it is so enormous that only a large expedition, with a very\r\nspecial equipment, could hope to #VB# with it.  Should we attempt to do\r\nso ourselves, the only possible result must be that we shall never\r\nreturn with the important #NN# to science which we have already\r\ngained.  Professor Challenger has #VBN# means for getting us on to\r\nthis plateau when it appeared to be inaccessible; I think that we\r\nshould now call upon him to use the same ingenuity in getting us back\r\nto the world from which we came.\"",
    "I confess that as Summerlee stated his view it struck me as altogether\r\nreasonable.  Even Challenger was affected by the consideration that his\r\nenemies would never stand #VBN# if the #NN# of his\r\nstatements should never reach those who had doubted them.",
    "\"The problem of the descent is at first sight a formidable one,\" said\r\nhe, \"and yet I cannot doubt that the intellect can solve it.  I am\r\nprepared to agree with our colleague that a #JJ# stay in Maple\r\nWhite Land is at present #JJ#, and that the question of our\r\nreturn will soon have to be faced.  I absolutely refuse to leave,\r\nhowever, until we have made at least a superficial examination of this\r\ncountry, and are able to take back with us something in the nature of a\r\nchart.\"",
    "Professor Summerlee gave a #NN# of impatience.",
    "\"We have spent two long days in exploration,\" said he, \"and we are no\r\nwiser as to the actual #NN# of the place than when we started.  It\r\nis clear that it is all thickly wooded, and it would take months to\r\npenetrate it and to learn the relations of one part to another.  If\r\nthere were some central #NN# it would be different, but it all slopes\r\ndownwards, so far as we can see.  The farther we go the less likely it\r\nis that we will get any general view.\"",
    "It was at that moment that I had my inspiration.  My eyes chanced to\r\nlight upon the enormous #JJ# trunk of the gingko tree which cast its\r\nhuge branches over us.  Surely, if its #NN# exceeded that of all\r\nothers, its height must do the same.  If the #NN# of the plateau was\r\nindeed the highest point, then why should this mighty tree not prove to\r\nbe a #NN# which commanded the whole country?  Now, ever since I\r\nran wild as a lad in Ireland I have been a bold and #JJ#\r\n#NN#.  My comrades might be my #NNS# on the rocks, but I knew\r\nthat I would be supreme among those branches.  Could I only get my legs\r\non to the lowest of the giant #NN#, then it would be strange\r\nindeed if I could not make my way to the top.  My comrades were\r\ndelighted at my idea.",
    "\"Our young friend,\" said Challenger, #VBG# up the red apples of his\r\ncheeks, \"is capable of #JJ# exertions which would be impossible to\r\na man of a more solid, though possibly of a more commanding,\r\nappearance.  I #VBP# his resolution.\"",
    "\"By George, young fellah, you've put your hand on it!\" said Lord John,\r\nclapping me on the back.  \"How we never came to think of it before I\r\ncan't imagine!  There's not more than an hour of daylight left, but if\r\nyou take your notebook you may be able to get some rough sketch of the\r\nplace.  If we put these three ammunition cases under the branch, I will\r\nsoon #VB# you on to it.\"",
    "He stood on the boxes while I faced the trunk, and was #RB# raising\r\nme when Challenger sprang forward and gave me such a thrust with his\r\nhuge hand that he fairly shot me into the tree.  With both arms\r\n#VBG# the branch, I #VBD#  hard with my feet until I had worked,\r\nfirst my body, and then my knees, #IN# it.  There were three excellent\r\noff-shoots, like huge #NNS# of a ladder, above my head, and a tangle of\r\nconvenient branches beyond, so that I clambered onwards with such speed\r\nthat I soon lost sight of the ground and had nothing but foliage\r\nbeneath me.  Now and then I #VBN# a check, and once I had to shin\r\nup a #NN# for eight or ten feet, but I made excellent progress, and\r\nthe booming of Challenger's voice seemed to be a great distance beneath\r\nme. The tree was, however, enormous, and, looking upwards, I could see\r\nno #VBG# of the leaves above my head.  There was some thick,\r\n#NN# #NN# which seemed to be a #NN# upon a branch up which I\r\nwas #VBG#.  I leaned my head round it in order to see what was\r\nbeyond, and I nearly fell out of the tree in my surprise and horror at\r\nwhat I saw.",
    "A face was gazing into #NN# the distance of only a foot or two.\r\nThe creature that #VBN# it had been crouching behind the parasite, and\r\nhad looked round it at the same instant that I did.  It was a human\r\n#NN# at least it was far more human than any monkey's that I have\r\never seen.  It was long, whitish, and blotched with #NNS#, the nose\r\nflattened, and the lower #NN# projecting, with a #NN# of coarse\r\n#NNS# round the chin.  The eyes, which were under thick and heavy\r\nbrows, were bestial and ferocious, and as it opened its mouth to snarl\r\nwhat #VBD# like a curse at me I observed that it had curved, sharp\r\n#JJ# teeth.  For an instant I read hatred and menace in the evil\r\neyes.  Then, as quick as a flash, came an expression of overpowering\r\nfear.  There was a crash of broken boughs as it #VBD# wildly down into\r\nthe tangle of green.  I caught a glimpse of a hairy body like that of a\r\nreddish pig, and then it was gone amid a swirl of leaves and branches.",
    "\"What's the matter?\" shouted Roxton from below.  \"Anything wrong with\r\nyou?\"",
    "\"Did you see it?\" I cried, with my arms round the branch and all my\r\nnerves tingling.",
    "\"We heard a row, as if your foot had slipped.  What was it?\"",
    "I was so #VBN# at the sudden and strange appearance of this #NN#\r\nthat I hesitated whether I should not climb down again and tell my\r\nexperience to my companions.  But I was already so far up the great\r\ntree that it seemed a humiliation to return without having carried out\r\nmy mission.",
    "After a long pause, therefore, to recover my breath and my courage, I\r\ncontinued my ascent.  Once I put my weight upon a rotten branch and\r\nswung for a few #NNS# by my hands, but in the main it was all easy\r\nclimbing.  #RB# the leaves #VBN# around me, and I was aware,\r\nfrom the wind upon my face, that I had topped all the trees of the\r\nforest.  I was determined, however, not to look about me before I had\r\nreached the very highest point, so I scrambled on until I had got so\r\nfar that the #JJ# branch was bending beneath my weight.  There I\r\nsettled into a convenient #NN#, and, balancing myself #RB#, I found\r\nmyself looking down at a most wonderful panorama of this strange\r\ncountry in which we found ourselves.",
    "The sun was just above the #JJ# sky-line, and the evening was a\r\nparticularly bright and clear one, so that the whole extent of the\r\nplateau was visible beneath me.  It was, as seen from this height, of\r\nan oval #NN#, with a breadth of about thirty miles and a #NN# of\r\ntwenty.  Its general shape was that of a shallow #VB#, all the sides\r\nsloping down to a considerable lake in the center.  This lake may have\r\nbeen ten miles in circumference, and lay very green and beautiful in\r\nthe evening light, with a thick fringe of reeds at its edges, and with\r\nits surface broken by several yellow #NN#, which #VBD# golden in\r\nthe mellow sunshine.  A number of long dark objects, which were too\r\nlarge for #NNS# and too long for canoes, lay upon the edges of\r\nthese #NNS# of #NN#.  With my glass I could clearly see that they\r\nwere alive, but what their nature might be I could not imagine.",
    "From the side of the plateau on which we were, slopes of #JJ#, with\r\noccasional glades, stretched down for five or six miles to the central\r\nlake.  I could see at my very feet the glade of the iguanodons, and\r\nfarther off was a round opening in the trees which marked the swamp of\r\nthe pterodactyls.  On the side facing me, however, the plateau\r\npresented a very different aspect.  There the basalt cliffs of the\r\noutside were reproduced upon the inside, #VBG# an #NN# about\r\ntwo hundred feet high, with a #NN# slope beneath it.  #IN# the base\r\nof these red cliffs, some distance above the ground, I could see a\r\nnumber of dark holes through the glass, which I #VBN# to be the\r\n#NNS# of #NNS#.  At the opening of one of these something white was\r\nshimmering, but I was unable to make out what it was.  I sat #VBG#\r\nthe country until the sun had set and it was so dark that I could no\r\nlonger distinguish details.  Then I climbed down to my companions\r\nwaiting for me so eagerly at the bottom of the great tree.  For once I\r\nwas the hero of the expedition.  Alone I had thought of it, and alone I\r\nhad done it; and here was the chart which would save us a month's blind\r\n#VBG# among unknown dangers.  Each of them shook me solemnly by the\r\nhand.",
    "But before they discussed the details of my map I had to tell them of\r\nmy encounter with the ape-man among the branches.",
    "\"He has been there all the time,\" said I.",
    "\"How do you know that?\" asked Lord John.",
    "\"Because I have never been without that feeling that something\r\nmalevolent was watching us. I mentioned it to you, Professor\r\nChallenger.\"",
    "\"Our young friend certainly said something of the kind.  He is also the\r\none among us who is #VBN# with that Celtic temperament which would\r\nmake him sensitive to such impressions.\"",
    "\"The whole theory of #NN#\" began Summerlee, filling his pipe.",
    "\"Is too vast to be now discussed,\" said Challenger, with decision.\r\n\"Tell me, now,\" he added, with the air of a #NN# addressing a\r\n#JJ#, \"did you happen to observe whether the creature could\r\ncross its thumb over its palm?\"",
    "\"No, indeed.\"",
    "\"Had it a tail?\"",
    "\"Was the foot #NN#?\"",
    "\"I do not think it could have made off so fast among the branches if it\r\ncould not get a grip with its feet.\"",
    "\"In South America there are, if my memory serves me--you will check the\r\nobservation, Professor #NN# #NN# #NN# of monkeys,\r\nbut the #NN# #NN# is unknown.  It is clear, however, that he\r\nexists in this country, and that he is not the hairy, #NN#\r\nvariety, which is never seen out of Africa or the East.\"  (I was\r\ninclined to #NN#, as I looked at him, that I had seen his first\r\ncousin in Kensington.)  \"This is a #JJ# and #JJ# type, the\r\nlatter characteristic pointing to the fact that he spends his days in\r\n#JJ# seclusion.  The question which we have to face is whether he\r\n#NNS# more closely to the ape or the man.  In the latter case, he\r\nmay well #JJ# to what the #JJ# have called the 'missing link.'\r\nThe solution of this problem is our immediate duty.\"",
    "\"It is nothing of the sort,\" said Summerlee, abruptly.  \"Now that,\r\nthrough the intelligence and activity of Mr. Malone\" (I cannot help\r\n#VBG# the words), \"we have got our chart, our one and only immediate\r\nduty is to get ourselves safe and sound out of this awful place.\"",
    "\"The #NN# of civilization,\" groaned Challenger.",
    "\"The #NNS# of civilization, sir.  It is our task to put on record\r\nwhat we have seen, and to leave the further exploration to others.  You\r\nall #VBN# as much before Mr. Malone got us the chart.\"",
    "\"Well,\" said Challenger, \"I admit that my mind will be more at ease\r\nwhen I am assured that the result of our expedition has been conveyed\r\nto our friends.  How we are to get down from this place I have not as\r\nyet an idea.  I have never yet encountered any problem, however, which\r\nmy inventive brain was unable to solve, and I promise you that\r\nto-morrow I will turn my attention to the question of our descent.\"\r\nAnd so the matter was allowed to rest.",
    "But that evening, by the light of the fire and of a single candle, the\r\nfirst map of the lost world was elaborated.  Every detail which I had\r\nroughly noted from my #NN# was drawn out in its #JJ# place.\r\nChallenger's pencil #VBD# over the great blank which marked the lake.",

    "\"Why should you not take the chance of #VBG# your own name?\"\r\nsaid Summerlee, with his usual touch of #NN#.",
    "\"I trust, sir, that my name will have other and more personal claims\r\nupon #NN#,\" said Challenger, severely.  \"Any #NNS# can hand\r\ndown his #JJ# memory by imposing it upon a #NN# or a river.  I\r\nneed no such #NN#.\"",
    "Summerlee, with a twisted smile, was about to make some fresh assault\r\nwhen Lord John hastened to #VB#.",

    "\"By all means.  Let our young friend give it a name,\" said Challenger.",
    "\"Then,\" said I, #VBG#, I dare say, as I said it, \"let it be named\r\nLake Gladys.\"",
    "\"Don't you think the Central Lake would be more #JJ#?\" remarked\r\nSummerlee.",
    "\"I should prefer Lake Gladys.\"",

    "I have #NN# perhaps I have not said, for my memory #VBZ# me sad\r\ntricks these #NN# I #VBD# with pride when three such men as my\r\ncomrades thanked me for having saved, or at least greatly helped, the\r\nsituation.  As the #NN# of the party, not merely in years, but in\r\nexperience, character, knowledge, and all that goes to make a man, I\r\nhad been overshadowed from the first.  And now I was coming into my\r\nown.  I #VBD# at the thought.  #UH#! for the pride which goes before a\r\nfall!  That little glow of #NN#, that added measure of\r\n#NN#, were to lead me on that very night to the most\r\ndreadful experience of my life, ending with a shock which #VBZ# my\r\nheart sick when I think of it.",
    "It came about in this way.  I had been unduly excited by the adventure\r\nof the tree, and sleep seemed to be impossible.  Summerlee was on\r\nguard, sitting #VBN# over our small fire, a quaint, angular figure,\r\nhis rifle across his knees and his pointed, goat-like beard wagging\r\nwith each weary #NN# of his head.  Lord John lay silent, wrapped in the\r\nSouth American #NN# which he wore, while Challenger #VBN# with a\r\nroll and rattle which #VBN# through the woods.  The full moon\r\nwas shining brightly, and the air was #RB# cold.  What a night for a\r\nwalk!  And then suddenly came the thought, \"Why not?\"  Suppose I stole\r\nsoftly away, suppose I made my way down to the central lake, suppose I\r\nwas back at breakfast with some record of the #NN# I not in\r\nthat case be thought an even more worthy associate?  Then, if Summerlee\r\ncarried the day and some means of escape were found, we should return\r\nto London with #JJ# knowledge of the central mystery of the\r\nplateau, to which I alone, of all men, would have penetrated.  I thought\r\nof Gladys, with her \"There are heroisms all round us.\"  I seemed to hear\r\nher voice as she said it.  I thought also of McArdle.  What a three\r\ncolumn article for the paper!  What a #NN# for a career!  A\r\n#NN# in the next great war might be within my reach.  I\r\nclutched at a #NN# pockets were full of #NN#, #VBG# the\r\n#NN# bushes at the gate of our zareba, quickly slipped out.  My last\r\nglance showed me the unconscious Summerlee, most futile of sentinels,\r\nstill nodding away like a queer mechanical #NN# in front of the\r\nsmouldering fire.",
    "I had not gone a hundred yards before I deeply #VBN# my #NN#.  I\r\nmay have said somewhere in this #NN# that I am too imaginative to\r\nbe a really #JJ# man, but that I have an overpowering fear of\r\n#JJ# afraid.  This was the power which now carried me onwards.  I\r\nsimply could not #NN# back with nothing done.  Even if my comrades\r\nshould not have missed me, and should never know of my #NN#, there\r\nwould still remain some intolerable #NN# in my own soul.  And yet\r\nI shuddered at the position in which I found myself, and would have\r\ngiven all I possessed at that moment to have been #RB# free of the\r\nwhole business.",
    "It was dreadful in the forest.  The trees grew so thickly and their\r\nfoliage spread so #RB# that I could see nothing of the #NN#\r\nsave that here and there the high branches made a tangled #JJ#\r\nagainst the #NN# sky.  As the eyes became more used to the obscurity\r\none learned that there were different degrees of darkness among the\r\n#NN# some were dimly visible, while between and among them there\r\nwere #JJ# shadowed patches, like the mouths of caves, from which\r\nI shrank in horror as I passed.  I thought of the #JJ# yell of\r\nthe tortured #NN# dreadful cry which had echoed through the\r\nwoods.  I thought, too, of the glimpse I had in the light of Lord\r\nJohn's torch of that bloated, warty, #VBG# #NN#.  Even now\r\nI was on its hunting-ground.  At any instant it might spring upon me\r\nfrom the #NN# #JJ# and horrible monster.  I stopped, and,\r\npicking a #NN# from my pocket, I opened the #NN# of my gun.  As\r\nI touched the lever my heart #VBD# within me.  It was the shot-gun,\r\nnot the rifle, which I had taken!",
    "Again the impulse to return swept over me.  Here, surely, was a most\r\nexcellent reason for my #NN# for which no one would think the\r\nless of me.  But again the foolish pride fought against that very word.\r\nI could #NN# #NN#.  After all, my rifle would probably have\r\nbeen as useless as a shot-gun against such dangers as I might meet.  If\r\nI were to go back to camp to change my #NN# I could hardly expect to\r\nenter and to leave again without being seen.  In that case there would\r\nbe explanations, and my attempt would no longer be all my own.  After a\r\nlittle hesitation, then, I #VBN# up my courage and continued upon my\r\nway, my useless gun under my arm.",
    "The darkness of the forest had been alarming, but even worse was the\r\nwhite, still #NN# of #NN# in the open glade of the iguanodons.\r\n#NNP# among the bushes, I looked out at it.  None of the great brutes\r\nwere in sight.  Perhaps the tragedy which had befallen one of them had\r\ndriven them from their #NN#.  In the misty, silvery night I\r\ncould see no sign of any living thing.  #VBG# courage, therefore, I\r\nslipped rapidly across it, and among the jungle on the farther side I\r\npicked up once again the brook which was my guide.  It was a #JJ#\r\ncompanion, gurgling and chuckling as it ran, like the dear old\r\n#NN# in the West #NNP# where I have #VBN# at night in my\r\n#NN#.  So long as I followed it down I must come to the lake, and so\r\nlong as I followed it back I must come to the camp.  #RB# I had to\r\nlose sight of it on account of the tangled brush-wood, but I was always\r\nwithin #NN# of its tinkle and splash.",
    "As one descended the slope the woods became thinner, and bushes, with\r\noccasional high trees, took the place of the forest.  I could make good\r\nprogress, therefore, and I could see without being seen.  I passed\r\nclose to the pterodactyl swamp, and as I did so, with a dry, crisp,\r\nleathery rattle of wings, one of these great #NN# was twenty\r\nfeet at least from tip to #NN# up from somewhere near me and\r\nsoared into the air.  As it passed across the face of the moon the\r\nlight shone clearly through the membranous wings, and it looked like a\r\nflying skeleton against the white, tropical radiance.  I crouched low\r\namong the bushes, for I knew from past experience that with a single\r\ncry the creature could bring a hundred of its loathsome #NNS# about my\r\nears.  It was not until it had settled again that I dared to #VB#\r\nonwards upon my journey.",
    "The night had been exceedingly still, but as I advanced I became\r\nconscious of a low, rumbling sound, a continuous murmur, somewhere in\r\nfront of me.  This #NN# #JJR# as I proceeded, until at last it was\r\nclearly quite close to me.  When I stood still the sound was constant,\r\nso that it seemed to come from some #JJ# cause.  It was like a\r\nboiling #NN# or the #VBG# of some great pot.  #RB# I came upon the\r\nsource of it, for in the center of a small clearing I found a #NN#\r\na pool, rather, for it was not larger than the #NN# of the Trafalgar\r\nSquare #NN# some black, #NN# stuff, the surface of which\r\nrose and fell in great #NNS# of bursting gas.  The air above it was\r\nshimmering with heat, and the ground round was so hot that I could\r\nhardly bear to lay my hand on it.  It was clear that the great volcanic\r\noutburst which had raised this strange plateau so many years ago had\r\nnot yet entirely spent its forces.  #VBN# rocks and mounds of #NN#\r\nI had already seen everywhere #VBG# out from amid the luxuriant\r\nvegetation which #VBD# them, but this asphalt pool in the jungle was\r\nthe first sign that we had of actual #VBG# activity on the slopes of\r\nthe ancient crater.  I had no time to examine it further for I had need\r\nto hurry if I were to be back in camp in the morning.",
    "It was a fearsome walk, and one which will be with me so long as memory\r\nholds.  In the great moonlight #NNS# I #NN# along among the\r\nshadows on the margin.  In the jungle I crept forward, stopping with a\r\nbeating heart whenever I heard, as I often did, the crash of breaking\r\nbranches as some wild beast went past.  Now and then great shadows\r\nloomed up for an instant and were #NN#, silent shadows which\r\nseemed to #NN# upon #JJ# feet.  How often I stopped with the\r\nintention of returning, and yet every time my pride conquered my fear,\r\nand sent me on again until my object should be #VBD#.",
    "At last (my watch showed that it was one in the morning) I saw the\r\ngleam of water amid the #NNS# of the jungle, and ten minutes later I\r\nwas among the reeds upon the #NNS# of the central lake.  I was\r\nexceedingly dry, so I lay down and took a long #NN# of its waters,\r\nwhich were fresh and cold.  There was a broad pathway with many tracks\r\nupon it at the spot which I had found, so that it was clearly one of\r\nthe #NNS# of the animals.  Close to the water's edge there\r\nwas a huge isolated block of lava.  #IN# this I climbed, and, lying on\r\nthe top, I had an excellent view in every direction.",
    "The first thing which I saw filled me with amazement.  When I described\r\nthe view from the summit of the great tree, I said that on the farther\r\ncliff I could see a number of dark spots, which appeared to be the\r\nmouths of caves.  Now, as I looked up at the same cliffs, I saw #NNS#\r\nof light in every direction, ruddy, #VBN# patches, like the\r\n#NNS# of a liner in the darkness.  For a moment I thought it was\r\nthe #NN# from some volcanic action; but this could not be so.  Any\r\nvolcanic action would surely be down in the hollow and not high among\r\nthe rocks.  What, then, was the alternative?  It was wonderful, and yet\r\nit must surely be.  These ruddy spots must be the reflection of #NNS#\r\nwithin the #NN# which could only be lit by the hand of man.\r\nThere were human #NNS#, then, upon the plateau.  How #RB# my\r\nexpedition was justified!  Here was news indeed for us to bear back\r\nwith us to London!",
    "For a long time I lay and watched these red, quivering #NNS# of\r\nlight.  I suppose they were ten miles off from me, yet even at that\r\ndistance one could observe how, from time to time, they twinkled or\r\nwere obscured as someone passed before them.  What would I not have\r\ngiven to be able to #VB# up to them, to peep in, and to take back some\r\nword to my comrades as to the appearance and character of the race who\r\nlived in so strange a place!  It was out of the question for the\r\nmoment, and yet surely we could not leave the plateau until we had some\r\ndefinite knowledge upon the point.",
    "Lake #NN# own #NN# like a sheet of #JJ# before me,\r\nwith a #VBN# moon shining brightly in the center of it.  It was\r\nshallow, for in many places I saw low sandbanks protruding above the\r\nwater.  Everywhere upon the still surface I could see signs of life,\r\nsometimes mere rings and ripples in the water, sometimes the gleam of a\r\ngreat #VBN# fish in the air, sometimes the arched, slate-colored\r\nback of some passing monster.  Once upon a yellow sandbank I saw a\r\ncreature like a huge #NN#, with a clumsy body and a high, #JJ#\r\nneck, shuffling about upon the margin.  Presently it plunged in, and\r\nfor some time I could see the arched neck and #VBG# head undulating\r\nover the water.  Then it dived, and I saw it no more.",
    "My attention was soon drawn away from these distant #NNS# and brought\r\nback to what was going on at my very feet.  Two creatures like large\r\n#NNS# had come down to the #NN#, and were squatting at\r\nthe edge of the water, their long, flexible #NNS# like red #NNS#\r\nshooting in and out as they #VBD#.  A huge deer, with #VBG# #NNS#,\r\na magnificent creature which carried itself like a king, came down with\r\nits #NN# and two #NNS# and #VBD# beside the armadillos.  No such deer\r\nexist anywhere else upon earth, for the #NN# or #NNS# which I have seen\r\nwould hardly have reached its shoulders.  Presently it gave a warning\r\n#VB#, and was off with its family among the reeds, while the\r\narmadillos also scuttled for shelter.  A #NN#, a most monstrous\r\nanimal, was coming down the path.",
    "For a moment I wondered where I could have seen that #RB# shape,\r\nthat arched back with #JJ# fringes along it, that strange\r\n#NN# head held close to the ground.  Then it came back, to me.  It\r\nwas the #NN# very creature which Maple White had preserved\r\nin his sketch-book, and which had been the first object which arrested\r\nthe attention of Challenger!  There he #NN# the very specimen\r\nwhich the American artist had encountered.  The ground shook beneath\r\nhis tremendous weight, and his #NNS# of water resounded through the\r\nstill night.  For five minutes he was so close to my rock that by\r\nstretching out my hand I could have touched the hideous waving #NNS#\r\nupon his back.  Then he lumbered away and was lost among the boulders.",
    "Looking at my watch, I saw that it was half-past two o'clock, and high\r\ntime, therefore, that I started upon my #RB# journey.  There was no\r\ndifficulty about the direction in which I should return for all along I\r\nhad kept the little brook upon my left, and it opened into the central\r\nlake within a stone'#NN# of the #NN# upon which I had been lying.\r\nI set off, therefore, in high spirits, for I felt that I had done good\r\nwork and was bringing back a fine #NN# of news for my companions.\r\n#RB# of all, of course, were the sight of the fiery caves and the\r\ncertainty that some #NN# race inhabited them.  But besides that\r\nI could speak from experience of the central lake.  I could testify\r\nthat it was full of strange creatures, and I had seen several land\r\nforms of primeval life which we had not before encountered.  I\r\nreflected as I walked that few men in the world could have spent a\r\nstranger night or added more to human knowledge in the course of it.",
    "I was #VBG# up the slope, turning these thoughts over in my mind,\r\nand had reached a point which may have been half-way to home, when my\r\nmind was brought back to my own position by a strange noise behind me.\r\nIt was something between a #NN# and a growl, low, deep, and\r\nexceedingly menacing.  Some strange creature was evidently near me, but\r\nnothing could be seen, so I hastened more rapidly upon my way.  I had\r\ntraversed half a mile or so when suddenly the sound was repeated, still\r\nbehind me, but louder and more menacing than before.  My heart stood\r\nstill within me as it flashed across me that the beast, whatever it\r\nwas, must surely be after #PRP#.   My skin grew cold and my hair rose at\r\nthe thought.  That these monsters should #VB# each other to pieces was\r\na part of the strange struggle for existence, but that they should turn\r\nupon modern man, that they should #RB# track and hunt down the\r\n#JJ# human, was a #JJ# and fearsome thought.  I remembered\r\nagain the #VBN# face which we had seen in the glare of Lord\r\nJohn's torch, like some horrible vision from the deepest circle of\r\nDante's hell.  With my knees shaking beneath me, I stood and glared\r\nwith starting eyes down the moonlit path which lay behind me.  All was\r\nquiet as in a dream landscape.  #NN# clearings and the black patches\r\nof the #VBG# else could I see.  Then from out of the silence,\r\n#JJ# and threatening, there came once more that low, throaty\r\ncroaking, far louder and closer than before.  There could no longer be\r\na doubt.  Something was on my trail, and was closing in upon me every\r\nminute.",
    "I stood like a man paralyzed, still staring at the ground which I had\r\ntraversed.  Then suddenly I saw it.  There was movement among the\r\nbushes at the far end of the clearing which I had just traversed.  A\r\ngreat dark shadow #VBN# itself and hopped out into the clear\r\nmoonlight.  I say \"hopped\" #RB#, for the beast moved like a\r\n#NN#, springing along in an #NN# position upon its powerful hind\r\nlegs, while its front ones were held bent in front of it.  It was of\r\nenormous size and power, like an erect #NN#, but its movements, in\r\nspite of its bulk, were exceedingly alert.  For a moment, as I saw its\r\nshape, I hoped that it was an iguanodon, which I knew to be harmless,\r\nbut, ignorant as I was, I soon saw that this was a very different\r\ncreature.  Instead of the gentle, #VBN# head of the great\r\nthree-toed #NN#, this beast had a broad, squat, #NN# face\r\nlike that which had alarmed us in our camp.  His ferocious cry and the\r\nhorrible energy of his pursuit both assured me that this was surely one\r\nof the great flesh-eating dinosaurs, the most terrible beasts which\r\nhave ever walked this earth.  As the huge brute #VBD# along it dropped\r\nforward upon its #NNS# and brought its nose to the ground every\r\ntwenty yards or so.  It was #VBG# out my trail.  Sometimes, for an\r\ninstant, it was at fault.  Then it would catch it up again and come\r\nbounding swiftly along the path I had taken.",
    "Even now when I think of that nightmare the sweat breaks out upon my\r\nbrow.  What could I do?  My useless #NN# was in my hand.  What\r\nhelp could I get from that?  I looked desperately round for some rock\r\nor tree, but I was in a #JJ# jungle with nothing higher than a sapling\r\nwithin sight, while I knew that the creature behind me could tear down\r\nan ordinary tree as though it were a #VBN#.  My only possible chance lay\r\nin flight.  I could not move swiftly over the rough, broken ground, but\r\nas I looked round me in despair I saw a #VBN#, #NN# path\r\nwhich ran across in front of me.  We had seen several of the sort, the\r\nruns of various wild beasts, during our expeditions.  Along this I\r\ncould perhaps hold my own, for I was a fast #NN#, and in excellent\r\ncondition.  #VBG# away my useless gun, I set myself to do such a\r\n#JJ# as I have never done before or since.  My limbs #VBD#, my\r\nchest #VBD#, I felt that my throat would #VB# for want of air, and\r\nyet with that horror behind me I ran and I ran and ran.  At last I\r\npaused, hardly able to move.  For a moment I thought that I had thrown\r\nhim off.  The path lay still behind me.  And then suddenly, with a\r\ncrashing and a rending, a #VBG# of giant feet and a panting of\r\nmonster #NNS# the beast was upon me once more.  He was at my very\r\nheels.  I was lost.",
    "#NN# that I was to linger so long before I fled!  Up to then he had\r\n#VBN# by scent, and his movement was slow.  But he had actually seen\r\nme as I started to run.  From then onwards he had hunted by sight, for\r\nthe path showed him where I had gone.  Now, as he came round the curve,\r\nhe was springing in great #NNS#.  The moonlight shone upon his huge\r\nprojecting eyes, the row of enormous teeth in his open mouth, and the\r\ngleaming fringe of claws upon his short, powerful #NNS#.  With a\r\nscream of terror I turned and rushed wildly down the path.  Behind me\r\nthe thick, gasping breathing of the creature sounded louder and louder.\r\nHis heavy #NN# was beside me.  Every instant I expected to feel his\r\ngrip upon my back.  And then suddenly there came a #NN# was falling\r\nthrough space, and everything beyond was darkness and rest.",
    "As I emerged from my #NN# could not, I think, have\r\nlasted more than a few #NN# was aware of a most dreadful and\r\npenetrating smell.  Putting out my hand in the darkness I came upon\r\nsomething which felt like a huge #NN# of meat, while my other hand\r\nclosed upon a large bone.  Up above me there was a circle of #NN#\r\nsky, which showed me that I was lying at the bottom of a deep pit.\r\nSlowly I staggered to my feet and felt myself all over.  I was stiff\r\nand #JJ# from head to foot, but there was no #NN# which would not move,\r\nno joint which would not #VB#.  As the circumstances of my fall came\r\nback into my confused brain, I looked up in terror, #VBG# to see\r\nthat dreadful head #VBN# against the #VBG# sky.  There was no\r\nsign of the monster, however, nor could I hear any sound from above.  I\r\nbegan to walk slowly round, therefore, feeling in every direction to\r\nfind out what this strange place could be into which I had been so\r\n#RB# precipitated.",
    "It was, as I have said, a pit, with #VBG# walls and a level\r\nbottom about twenty feet across.  This bottom was littered with great\r\n#NNS# of flesh, most of which was in the last state of #NN#.\r\nThe atmosphere was poisonous and horrible.  After #VBG# and\r\nstumbling over these lumps of decay, I came suddenly against something\r\nhard, and I found that an #RB# post was firmly fixed in the center\r\nof the hollow.  It was so high that I could not reach the top of it\r\nwith my hand, and it appeared to be covered with #NN#.",
    "Suddenly I remembered that I had a tin box of #NN# in my pocket.\r\n#VBG# one of them, I was able at last to form some opinion of this\r\nplace into which I had fallen.  There could be no question as to its\r\nnature.  It was a #NN# by the hand of man.  The post in the\r\ncenter, some nine feet long, was #VBN# at the upper end, and was\r\nblack with the #JJ# blood of the creatures who had been impaled upon\r\nit.  The remains scattered about were #NNS# of the victims, which\r\nhad been cut away in order to clear the stake for the next who might\r\nblunder in.  I remembered that Challenger had declared that man could\r\nnot exist upon the plateau, since with his feeble #NNS# he could not\r\nhold his own against the monsters who #VBD# over it.  But now it was\r\nclear enough how it could be done.  In their #VBN# caves the\r\nnatives, whoever they might be, had #NNS# into which the huge\r\nsaurians could not penetrate, while with their #VBN# brains they\r\nwere capable of setting such #NNS#, covered with branches, across the\r\npaths which marked the run of the animals as would #VB# them in\r\nspite of all their strength and activity.  Man was always the master.",
    "The sloping wall of the pit was not difficult for an active man to\r\nclimb, but I hesitated long before I trusted myself within reach of the\r\ndreadful creature which had so nearly destroyed me.  How did I know\r\nthat he was not lurking in the nearest clump of bushes, waiting for my\r\n#NN#?  I took heart, however, as I recalled a conversation\r\nbetween Challenger and Summerlee upon the habits of the great saurians.\r\nBoth were agreed that the monsters were #RB# #NN#, that\r\nthere was no room for reason in their tiny cranial #NNS#, and that\r\nif they have disappeared from the rest of the world it was assuredly on\r\naccount of their own stupidity, which made it impossible for them to\r\nadapt themselves to changing conditions.",
    "To lie in wait for me now would mean that the creature had appreciated\r\nwhat had happened to me, and this in turn would argue some power\r\n#VBG# cause and effect.  Surely it was more likely that a\r\nbrainless creature, acting #RB# by vague #JJ# instinct, would\r\ngive up the chase when I disappeared, and, after a pause of\r\nastonishment, would wander away in search of some other #NN#?  I\r\nclambered to the edge of the pit and looked over.  The stars were\r\nfading, the sky was #VBG#, and the cold wind of morning blew\r\npleasantly upon my face.  I could see or hear nothing of my enemy.\r\nSlowly I climbed out and sat for a while upon the ground, ready to\r\nspring back into my refuge if any danger should appear.  Then,\r\n#VBN# by the absolute #NN# and by the growing light, I took my\r\ncourage in both hands and stole back along the path which I had come.\r\nSome distance down it I picked up my gun, and shortly afterwards struck\r\nthe brook which was my guide.  So, with many a frightened backward\r\nglance, I made for home.",
    "And suddenly there came something to remind me of my #JJ# companions.\r\nIn the clear, still morning air there sounded far away the sharp, hard\r\nnote of a single #NN#.  I paused and listened, but there was\r\nnothing more.  For a moment I was shocked at the thought that some\r\nsudden danger might have befallen them.  But then a simpler and more\r\nnatural explanation came to my mind.  It was now broad daylight.  No\r\ndoubt my absence had been noticed.  They had imagined, that I was lost\r\nin the woods, and had fired this shot to guide me home.  It is true\r\nthat we had made a strict resolution against #VBG#, but if it seemed\r\nto them that I might be in danger they would not #VB#.  It was for\r\nme now to hurry on as fast as possible, and so to #VB# them.",
    "I was weary and spent, so my progress was not so fast as I wished; but\r\nat last I came into regions which I knew.  There was the swamp of the\r\npterodactyls upon my left; there in front of me was the glade of the\r\niguanodons.  Now I was in the last belt of trees which separated me\r\nfrom Fort Challenger.  I raised my voice in a cheery shout to allay\r\ntheir #NNS#.  No answering greeting came back to me.  My heart sank at\r\nthat ominous stillness.  I #VBD# my pace into a run.  The zareba\r\nrose before me, even as I had left it, but the gate was open.  I rushed\r\nin.  In the cold, morning light it was a fearful sight which met my\r\neyes.  Our effects were scattered in wild confusion over the ground; my\r\ncomrades had disappeared, and close to the smouldering ashes of our\r\nfire the grass was stained crimson with a hideous pool of blood.",
    "I was so stunned by this sudden shock that for a time I must have\r\nnearly lost my reason.  I have a vague recollection, as one #VBZ# a\r\nbad dream, of #VBG# about through the woods all round the empty camp,\r\ncalling wildly for my companions.  No answer came back from the silent\r\nshadows.  The horrible thought that I might never see them again, that\r\nI might find myself abandoned all alone in that dreadful place, with no\r\npossible way of descending into the world below, that I might live and\r\ndie in that nightmare country, drove me to #NN#.  I could have\r\ntorn my hair and beaten my head in my despair.  Only now did I realize\r\nhow I had learned to lean upon my companions, upon the #JJ#\r\nself-confidence of Challenger, and upon the masterful, humorous\r\n#NN# of Lord John Roxton.  Without them I was like a child in the\r\ndark, #JJ# and powerless.  I did not know which way to turn or what\r\nI should do first.",
    "After a period, during which I sat in #NN#, I set myself to try\r\nand discover what sudden #NN# could have befallen my companions.\r\nThe whole #JJ# appearance of the camp showed that there had been\r\nsome sort of attack, and the rifle-shot no doubt marked the time when\r\nit had occurred.  That there should have been only one shot showed that\r\nit had been all over in an instant.  The rifles still lay upon the\r\nground, and one of #NN# John'#NN# the empty cartridge in the\r\nbreech.  The blankets of Challenger and of Summerlee beside the fire\r\nsuggested that they had been asleep at the time.  The cases of\r\nammunition and of food were scattered about in a wild litter, together\r\nwith our unfortunate #NNS# and #NNS#, but none of them were\r\nmissing.  On the other hand, all the exposed #NN# I\r\nremembered that there were a considerable quantity of #NN# gone.\r\nThey were animals, then, and not natives, who had made the #NN#, for\r\nsurely the latter would have left nothing behind.",
    "But if animals, or some single terrible animal, then what had become of\r\nmy comrades?  A ferocious beast would surely have destroyed them and\r\nleft their remains.  It is true that there was that one hideous pool of\r\nblood, which told of violence.  Such a monster as had pursued me during\r\nthe night could have carried away a victim as easily as a cat would a\r\n#NN#.  In that case the others would have followed in pursuit.  But\r\nthen they would assuredly have taken their rifles with them.  The more\r\nI tried to think it out with my confused and weary brain the less could\r\nI find any plausible explanation.  I #VBD# round in the forest, but\r\ncould see no tracks which could help me to a conclusion.  Once I lost\r\nmyself, and it was only by good luck, and after an hour of wandering,\r\nthat I found the camp once more.",
    "Suddenly a thought came to me and brought some little comfort to my\r\nheart.  I was not absolutely alone in the world.  Down at the bottom of\r\nthe cliff, and within call of me, was waiting the faithful Zambo.  I\r\nwent to the edge of the plateau and looked over.  Sure enough, he was\r\nsquatting among his blankets beside his fire in his little camp.  But,\r\nto my amazement, a second man was seated in front of him.  For an\r\ninstant my heart leaped for joy, as I thought that one of my comrades\r\nhad made his way safely down.  But a second glance #VBN# the hope.\r\nThe rising sun shone red upon the man's skin.  He was an Indian.  I\r\nshouted #RB# and waved my handkerchief.  Presently Zambo looked up,\r\nwaved his hand, and turned to ascend the pinnacle.  In a short time he\r\nwas standing close to me and listening with deep #NN# to the story\r\nwhich I told him.",
    "\"Devil got them for sure, Massa Malone,\" said he.  \"You got into the\r\ndevil's country, #NN#, and he take you all to himself.  You take advice,\r\nMassa Malone, and come down quick, else he get you as well.\"",
    "\"How can I come down, Zambo?\"",
    "\"You get #NNS# from trees, Massa Malone.  #VB# them over here.  I\r\nmake fast to this stump, and so you have bridge.\"",
    "\"We have thought of that.  There are no creepers here which could bear\r\nus.\"",
    "\"#VB# for #NNS#, Massa Malone.\"",
    "\"Who can I send, and where?\"",
    "\"Send to Indian villages, sah.  #NN# hide rope in Indian village.\r\nIndian down below; send him.\"",
    "\"Who is he?",
    "\"One of our Indians.  #JJ# ones beat him and take away his pay.  He\r\ncome back to us.  #JJ# now to take letter, bring rope,#VBG#.\"",
    "To take a letter!  Why not?  Perhaps he might bring help; but in any\r\ncase he would ensure that our lives were not spent for nothing, and\r\nthat news of all that we had won for Science should reach our friends\r\nat home.  I had two completed letters already waiting.  I would spend\r\nthe day in writing a third, which would bring my experiences absolutely\r\nup to date.  The Indian could bear this back to the world.  I ordered\r\nZambo, therefore, to come again in the evening, and I spent my\r\nmiserable and lonely day in recording my own adventures of the night\r\nbefore.  I also drew up a note, to be given to any white #NN# or\r\ncaptain of a #NN# whom the Indian could find, #VBG# them to\r\nsee that ropes were sent to us, since our lives must depend upon it.\r\nThese documents I threw to Zambo in the evening, and also my purse,\r\nwhich contained three English #NNS#.  These were to be given to\r\nthe Indian, and he was promised twice as much if he returned with the\r\nropes.",
    "So now you will understand, my dear Mr. McArdle, how this communication\r\nreaches you, and you will also know the truth, in case you never hear\r\nagain from your unfortunate #NN#.  To-night I am too weary and\r\ntoo #JJ# to make my plans.  To-morrow I must think out some way by\r\nwhich I shall keep in touch with this camp, and yet search round for\r\nany traces of my unhappy friends.",
    "                           CHAPTER XIII",
    "               \"A #NN# which I shall Never Forget\"",
    "Just as the sun was setting upon that melancholy night I saw the lonely\r\nfigure of the Indian upon the vast plain beneath me, and I watched him,\r\nour one faint hope of #NN#, until he disappeared in the rising\r\nmists of evening which lay, #VBN# from the setting sun, between\r\nthe #JJ# river and me.",
    "It was quite dark when I at last turned back to our stricken camp, and\r\nmy last vision as I went was the red gleam of Zambo's fire, the one\r\npoint of light in the wide world below, as was his faithful presence in\r\nmy own shadowed soul.  And yet I felt #JJR# than I had done since\r\nthis crushing blow had fallen upon me, for it was good to think that\r\nthe world should know what we had done, so that at the worst our names\r\nshould not #VB# with our bodies, but should go down to posterity\r\nassociated with the result of our labors.",
    "It was an awesome thing to sleep in that ill-fated camp; and yet it was\r\neven more #VBG# to do so in the jungle.  One or the other it must\r\nbe.  #NNP#, on the one hand, warned me that I should remain on\r\nguard, but exhausted Nature, on the other, declared that I should do\r\nnothing of the kind.  I climbed up on to a limb of the great gingko\r\ntree, but there was no #NN# #NN# on its rounded surface, and I\r\nshould certainly have fallen off and broken my neck the moment I began\r\nto #NN#.  I got down, therefore, and #VBD# over what I should do.\r\nFinally, I closed the door of the zareba, lit three separate fires in a\r\n#NN#, and having #VBN# a hearty supper dropped off into a profound\r\nsleep, from which I had a strange and most welcome #VBG#.  In the\r\nearly morning, just as day was breaking, a hand was laid upon my arm,\r\nand starting up, with all my nerves in a #NN# and my hand feeling for\r\na rifle, I gave a cry of joy as in the cold gray light I saw Lord John\r\nRoxton #VBG# beside me.",
    "It was #NN# yet it was not he.  I had left him calm in his bearing,\r\ncorrect in his person, prim in his dress.  Now he was pale and\r\n#JJ#, gasping as he breathed like one who has run far and fast.\r\nHis gaunt face was #VBD# and #JJ#, his clothes were hanging in\r\nrags, and his hat was gone.  I stared in amazement, but he gave me no\r\nchance for questions.  He was #VBG# at our stores all the time he\r\nspoke.",
    "\"Quick, young fellah!  Quick!\" he cried.  \"Every moment counts.  Get\r\nthe rifles, both of them.  I have the other two.  Now, all the\r\ncartridges you can gather.  #VB# up your pockets.  Now, some food.\r\nHalf a dozen tins will do.  That's all right!  Don't wait to talk or\r\nthink.  Get a move on, or we are done!\"",
    "Still #NN#, and unable to imagine what it all might mean, I found\r\nmyself #VBG# #RB# after him through the wood, a rifle under each\r\narm and a pile of various stores in my hands.  He #VBD# in and out\r\nthrough the #JJS# of the #NN# until he came to a dense clump of\r\nbrush-wood.  #IN# this he rushed, #RB# of #NNS#, and threw\r\nhimself into the heart of it, pulling me down by his side.",
    "\"There!\" he panted.  \"I think we are safe here.  They'll make for the\r\ncamp as sure as fate.  It will be their first idea.  But this should\r\n#NN# '#PRP#.\"",
    "\"What is it all?\" I asked, when I had got my breath.  \"Where are the\r\nprofessors?  And who is it that is after us?\"",
    "\"The #NN#,\" he cried.  \"My God, what brutes!  Don't raise your\r\nvoice, for they have long #NN# eyes, too, but no power of scent,\r\nso far as I could judge, so I don't think they can #VB# us out.  Where\r\nhave you been, young fellah?  You were well out of it.\"",
    "In a few sentences I whispered what I had done.",
    "\"Pretty bad,\" said he, when he had heard of the dinosaur and the pit.\r\n\"It isn't quite the place for a rest cure.  What?  But I had no idea\r\nwhat its possibilities were until those #NNS# got hold of us.  The\r\n#NN#' #NNS# had me once, but they are #NN# compared to\r\nthis crowd.\"",
    "\"How did it happen?\" I asked.",
    "\"It was in the early mornin'.  Our learned friends were just #VBG#'.\r\n#NN#'t even begun to argue yet.  Suddenly it #VBD# apes.  They came\r\ndown as thick as apples out of a tree.  They had been #NN#' in the\r\ndark, I suppose, until that great tree over our heads was heavy with\r\nthem.  I shot one of them through the #RB#, but before we knew where\r\nwe were they had us #VBN# on our backs.  I call them apes, but\r\nthey carried #NNS# and stones in their hands and #VBN# talk to each\r\nother, and ended up by #NN#' our hands with creepers, so they are ahead\r\nof any beast that I have seen in my #NN#'s.  #NN#'s what\r\nthey #NN#' #NNP#, and I wish they had stayed #NN#'.  They\r\ncarried off their wounded #NN# was #NN#' like a #NN# then\r\nthey sat around us, and if ever I saw #VBN# murder it was in their\r\nfaces.  They were big fellows, as big as a man and a deal stronger.\r\nCurious #JJ# gray eyes they have, under red tufts, and they just sat\r\nand #VBD# and gloated.  Challenger is no chicken, but even he was\r\ncowed.  He managed to struggle to his feet, and #VBD# out at them to\r\nhave done with it and get it over.  I think he had gone a bit off his\r\nhead at the #NN# of it, for he #VBD# and cursed at them like a\r\nlunatic.  If they had been a row of his favorite #NN# he could not\r\nhave #VBN# them worse.\"",
    "\"Well, what did they do?\"  I was #JJ# by the strange story which\r\nmy companion was whispering into my ear, while all the time his keen\r\neyes were shooting in every direction and his hand #VBG# his cocked\r\nrifle.",
    "\"I thought it was the end of us, but instead of that it started them on\r\na new line.  They all jabbered and chattered together.  Then one of\r\nthem stood out beside Challenger.  You'll smile, young fellah, but '#NN#\r\nmy word they might have been #NN#.  I couldn't have believed it if I\r\nhadn't seen it with my own eyes.  This old #NN# was their\r\n#NNS# a sort of red Challenger, with every one of our friend's\r\nbeauty points, only just a trifle more so.  He had the short body, the\r\nbig shoulders, the round chest, no neck, a great ruddy #NN# of a\r\nbeard, the tufted eyebrows, the 'What do you want, #JJ# you!' look\r\nabout the eyes, and the whole #NN#.  When the ape-man stood by\r\nChallenger and put his paw on his shoulder, the thing was complete.\r\nSummerlee was a bit #JJ#, and he laughed till he cried.  The\r\nape-men laughed #NN# at least they put up the devil of a\r\n#NN#'--and they set to work to drag us off through the forest.  They\r\nwouldn't touch the guns and #NN# them dangerous, I\r\n#NN# they carried away all our loose food.  Summerlee and I got\r\nsome rough #NN#' on the #NN#'s my skin and my clothes to prove\r\n#NN# they took us a #NN# through the brambles, and their own\r\nhides are like leather.  But Challenger was all right.  Four of them\r\ncarried him shoulder high, and he went like a #NNP# #NN#.  What's\r\nthat?\"",
    "It was a strange #VBG# noise in the distance not unlike #NNS#.",
    "\"There they go!\" said my companion, #VBG# cartridges into the second\r\ndouble #VBN# \"Express.\"  \"#NN# them all up, young fellah my lad,\r\nfor we're not going to be taken alive, and don't you think it!  That's\r\nthe row they make when they are excited.  By George! they'll have\r\nsomething to excite them if they put us up.  The 'Last Stand of the\r\n#NNS#' won't be in it.   'With their rifles grasped in their #VBD#\r\nhands, #JJ# a ring of the dead and #NN#',' as some #NN# #VBZ#.  Can\r\nyou hear them now?\"",
    "\"Very far away.\"",
    "\"That little lot will do no good, but I expect their search #NNS# are\r\nall over the wood.  Well, I was telling you my tale of #NN#.  They got\r\nus soon to this town of #NN# a thousand huts of branches and\r\nleaves in a great grove of trees near the edge of the cliff.  It's\r\nthree or four miles from here.  The filthy beasts #VBD# me all over,\r\nand I feel as if I should never be clean again.  They tied us #NN#\r\nfellow who handled me could tie like a #NN# there we lay with our\r\ntoes up, beneath a tree, while a great brute stood guard over us with a\r\nclub in his hand.  When I say 'we' I mean Summerlee and myself.  Old\r\nChallenger was up a tree, #NN#' #NNS# and #VBG#' the time of his life.\r\nI'm bound to say that he managed to get some fruit to us, and with his\r\nown hands he #VBN# our bonds.  If you'd seen him sitting up in that\r\ntree #NN#' with his #JJ# #NN# #NN#' in that #NN#'\r\nbass of his, 'Ring out, wild #NNS#,' cause music of any kind seemed to\r\nput 'em in a good humor, you'd have smiled; but we #NN#'t in much mood\r\nfor #NN#', as you can guess.  They were inclined, within limits, to\r\nlet him do what he liked, but they drew the line pretty sharply at us.\r\nIt was a mighty consolation to us all to know that you were runnin'\r\nloose and had the archives in your #NN#'.",
    "\"Well, now, young fellah, I'll tell you what will surprise you.  You\r\nsay you saw signs of men, and fires, traps, and the like.  Well, we\r\nhave seen the natives themselves.  Poor devils they were, #VBN#\r\nlittle chaps, and had enough to make them so.  It seems that the #NNS#\r\nhold one side of this #NN# yonder, where you saw the\r\n#NN# the ape-men hold this side, and there is bloody war between\r\nthem all the time.  That's the situation, so far as I could follow it.\r\nWell, yesterday the ape-men got hold of a dozen of the humans and\r\nbrought them in as #NNS#.  You never heard such a #NN#' and\r\n#NN#' in your life.  The men were little red fellows, and had been\r\nbitten and #VBN# so that they could hardly walk.  The ape-men put two\r\nof them to death there and #RB# pulled the arm off one of\r\n#NN# was perfectly #RB#.  #JJ# little chaps they are, and\r\nhardly gave a #NN#.  But it turned us absolutely sick.  Summerlee\r\nfainted, and even Challenger had as much as he could stand.  I think\r\nthey have cleared, don't you?\"",
    "We listened intently, but nothing save the calling of the birds broke\r\nthe deep peace of the forest.  Lord Roxton went on with his story.",
    "\"I think you have had the escape of your life, young fellah my lad.  It\r\nwas #NN#' those Indians that put you clean out of their heads, else\r\nthey would have been back to the camp for you as sure as fate and\r\ngathered you in.  Of course, as you said, they have been #NN#' us\r\nfrom the #NN#' out of that tree, and they knew perfectly well that\r\nwe were one short.  However, they could think only of this new #NN#; so\r\nit was I, and not a bunch of apes, that dropped in on you in the\r\nmorning.  Well, we had a #JJ# business afterwards.  My God!  what a\r\nnightmare the whole thing is!  You remember the great bristle of sharp\r\ncanes down below where we found the skeleton of the American?  Well,\r\nthat is just under #NN#, and that's the #NN#'#NN# place of their\r\nprisoners.  I expect there's #NNS# of #NNS# there, if we looked for\r\n'em.  They have a sort of clear #NN# on the top, and they make\r\na proper ceremony about it.  One by one the poor devils have to jump,\r\nand the game is to see whether they are merely dashed to pieces or\r\nwhether they get #VBN# on the canes.  They took us out to see it,\r\nand the whole tribe #VBN# up on the edge.  Four of the Indians jumped,\r\nand the canes went through 'em like #NN#' #NNS# through a #JJ# of\r\n#NN#.  No wonder we found that poor Yankee's skeleton with the canes\r\n#NN#' between his ribs.  It was #NN# it was #RB#\r\n#NN#' too.  We were all #VBN# to see them take the #NN#,\r\neven when we thought it would be our turn next on the #NN#.",
    "\"Well, it wasn't.  They kept six of the Indians up for #NN#'s\r\nhow I understood #NN# I fancy we were to be the #NN# #NNS# in\r\nthe show.  Challenger might get off, but Summerlee and I were in the\r\n#NN#.  Their language is more than half signs, and it was not hard to\r\nfollow them.  So I thought it was time we made a break for it.  I had\r\nbeen #NN#' it out a bit, and had one or two things clear in my mind.\r\nIt was all on me, for Summerlee was useless and Challenger not much\r\nbetter.  The only time they got together they got #NN#' because they\r\ncouldn't agree upon the scientific classification of these red-headed\r\ndevils that had got hold of us.  One said it was the #NNS# of\r\n#NNP#, the other said it was #NNS#.  #NN#, I call\r\n#NNS#, both.  But, as I say, I had thought out one or two points\r\nthat were helpful.  One was that these brutes could not run as fast as\r\na man in the open.  They have short, #NN# legs, you see, and heavy\r\nbodies.  Even Challenger could give a few yards in a hundred to the\r\nbest of them, and you or I would be a perfect #NN#.  Another point\r\nwas that they knew nothin' about guns.  I don't believe they ever\r\nunderstood how the fellow I shot came by his hurt.  If we could get at\r\nour guns there was no #NN#' what we could do.",
    "\"So I broke away early this mornin', gave my guard a #NN# in the #NN#\r\nthat laid him out, and #VBD# for the camp.  There I got you and the\r\nguns, and here we are.\"",
    "\"But the professors!\" I cried, in #NN#.",
    "\"Well, we must just go back and fetch 'em.  I couldn't bring 'em with\r\nme.  Challenger was up the tree, and Summerlee was not fit for the\r\neffort.  The only chance was to get the guns and try a #NN#.  Of\r\ncourse they may #NN# them at once in revenge.  I don't think they\r\nwould #VB# Challenger, but I wouldn't answer for Summerlee.  But they\r\nwould have had him in any case.  Of that I am certain.  So I haven't\r\nmade matters any worse by #NN#'.  But we are honor bound to go back\r\nand have them out or see it through with them.  So you can make up your\r\nsoul, young fellah my lad, for it will be one way or the other before\r\n#NN#'.\"",
    "I have tried to #VB# here Lord Roxton's jerky talk, his short,\r\nstrong sentences, the half-humorous, #NN# tone that ran\r\nthrough it all.  But he was a born leader.  As danger thickened his\r\njaunty manner would #VB#, his speech become more racy, his cold\r\neyes #NN# into ardent life, and his Don Quixote moustache bristle\r\nwith #JJ# excitement.  His love of danger, his intense appreciation\r\nof the drama of an #NN# the more intense for being held\r\n#RB# #NNS# consistent view that every #NN# in life is a form of\r\nsport, a fierce game #NN# you and Fate, with Death as a #NN#,\r\nmade him a wonderful companion at such hours.  If it were not for our\r\nfears as to the fate of our companions, it would have been a positive\r\njoy to throw myself with such a man into such an affair.  We were\r\nrising from our brushwood hiding-place when suddenly I felt his grip\r\nupon my arm.",
    "\"By George!\" he whispered, \"here they come!\"",
    "From where we lay we could look down a brown #NN#, arched with green,\r\nformed by the trunks and branches.  Along this a party of the ape-men\r\nwere passing.  They went in single file, with bent legs and rounded\r\nbacks, their hands occasionally touching the ground, their heads\r\nturning to left and right as they trotted along.  Their crouching #NN#\r\ntook away from their height, but I should put them at five feet or so,\r\nwith long arms and enormous #NNS#.  Many of them carried sticks, and\r\nat the distance they looked like a line of very hairy and #JJ#\r\nhuman beings.  For a moment I caught this clear glimpse of them.  Then\r\nthey were lost among the bushes.",
    "\"Not this time,\" said Lord John, who had caught up his rifle.  \"Our\r\nbest chance is to lie quiet until they have given up the search.  Then\r\nwe shall see whether we can't get back to their town and hit 'em where\r\nit #VBZ# most.  Give 'em an hour and we'll march.\"",
    "We filled in the time by opening one of our food tins and making sure\r\nof our breakfast.  Lord Roxton had had nothing but some fruit since the\r\nmorning before and #VBD# like a #VBG# man.  Then, at last, our pockets\r\n#VBG# with cartridges and a rifle in each hand, we started off upon\r\nour mission of rescue.  Before leaving it we carefully marked our\r\nlittle hiding-place among the brush-wood and its bearing to Fort\r\nChallenger, that we might find it again if we needed it.  We slunk\r\nthrough the bushes in silence until we came to the very edge of the\r\ncliff, close to the old camp.  There we halted, and Lord John gave me\r\nsome idea of his plans.",
    "\"So long as we are among the thick trees these swine are our masters,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"They can see us and we cannot see them.  But in the open it\r\nis different.  There we can move faster than they.  So we must stick to\r\nthe open all we can.  The edge of the plateau has fewer large trees\r\nthan further inland.  So that's our line of advance.  Go slowly, keep\r\nyour eyes open and your rifle ready.  Above all, never let them get you\r\nprisoner while there is a cartridge #NN#'s my last word to you,\r\nyoung fellah.\"",
    "When we reached the edge of the cliff I looked over and saw our good\r\nold black Zambo sitting smoking on a rock below us.  I would have given\r\na great deal to have hailed him and told him how we were placed, but it\r\nwas too dangerous, lest we should be heard.  The woods seemed to be\r\nfull of the ape-men; again and again we heard their curious clicking\r\nchatter.  At such times we plunged into the nearest clump of bushes and\r\nlay still until the sound had passed away.  Our advance, therefore, was\r\nvery slow, and two hours at least must have passed before I saw by Lord\r\nJohn's #JJ# movements that we must be close to our destination.  He\r\nmotioned to me to lie still, and he #VBD# forward himself.  In a\r\nminute he was back again, his face quivering with eagerness.",

    "A wide, open space lay before #NN# hundreds of yards #NN#\r\ngreen #NN# and low #NN# growing to the very edge of the cliff.\r\nRound this clearing there was a #NN# of trees with curious huts\r\nbuilt of foliage piled one above the other among the branches.  A\r\nrookery, with every nest a little house, would best convey the idea.\r\nThe openings of these huts and the branches of the trees were #VBN#\r\nwith a dense #NN# of #NN#, whom from their size I took to be the\r\nfemales and infants of the tribe.  They formed the background of the\r\npicture, and were all looking out with eager interest at the same scene\r\nwhich fascinated and bewildered us.",
    "In the open, and near the edge of the cliff, there had assembled a\r\ncrowd of some hundred of these #JJ#, #JJ# creatures, many of\r\nthem of immense size, and all of them horrible to look upon.  There was\r\na certain #NN# among them, for none of them attempted to break\r\nthe line which had been formed.  In front there stood a small group of\r\n#NN#, #VBN#, red fellows, whose skins glowed like\r\n#VBN# bronze in the strong sunlight.  A tall, thin white man was\r\nstanding beside them, his head bowed, his arms folded, his whole\r\nattitude expressive of his horror and dejection.  There was no\r\n#VBG# the angular form of Professor Summerlee.",
    "In front of and around this #VBN# group of prisoners were several\r\nape-men, who watched them closely and made all escape impossible.\r\nThen, right out from all the others and close to the edge of the cliff,\r\nwere two figures, so strange, and under other circumstances so\r\nludicrous, that they absorbed my attention.  The one was our comrade,\r\nProfessor Challenger.  The remains of his coat still hung in #NNS#\r\nfrom his shoulders, but his shirt had been all torn out, and his great\r\nbeard #VBN# itself in the black tangle which covered his mighty chest.\r\nHe had lost his hat, and his hair, which had grown long in our\r\n#NNS#, was flying in wild #NN#.  A single day seemed to have\r\nchanged him from the highest product of modern civilization to the most\r\ndesperate savage in South America.  Beside him stood his master, the\r\nking of the ape-men.  In all things he was, as Lord John had said, the\r\nvery image of our Professor, save that his coloring was red instead of\r\nblack.  The same short, broad figure, the same heavy shoulders, the\r\nsame forward hang of the arms, the same bristling beard #VBG# itself\r\nin the hairy chest.  Only above the eyebrows, where the sloping\r\nforehead and low, curved skull of the ape-man were in sharp #NN# to\r\nthe broad brow and magnificent #NN# of the European, could one see\r\nany marked difference.  At every other point the king was an absurd\r\n#NN# of the Professor.",
    "All this, which takes me so long to describe, impressed itself upon me\r\nin a few seconds.  Then we had very different things to think of, for\r\nan active drama was in progress.  Two of the ape-men had seized one of\r\nthe Indians out of the group and dragged him forward to the edge of the\r\ncliff.  The king raised his hand as a signal.  They caught the man by\r\nhis leg and arm, and swung him three times backwards and forwards with\r\ntremendous violence.  Then, with a frightful #NN# they shot the poor\r\nwretch over the precipice.  With such force did they throw him that he\r\ncurved high in the air before beginning to drop.  As he vanished from\r\nsight, the whole assembly, except the guards, rushed forward to the\r\nedge of the precipice, and there was a long pause of absolute silence,\r\nbroken by a mad yell of delight.  They sprang about, tossing their\r\nlong, hairy arms in the air and #VBG# with exultation.  Then they\r\nfell back from the edge, formed themselves again into line, and waited\r\nfor the next victim.",
    "This time it was Summerlee.  Two of his guards caught him by the #NNS#\r\nand pulled him #RB# to the front.  His thin figure and long limbs\r\nstruggled and fluttered like a chicken being dragged from a #NN#.\r\nChallenger had turned to the king and waved his hands frantically\r\nbefore him.  He was #VBG#, pleading, imploring for his comrade's\r\nlife.  The ape-man pushed him roughly aside and shook his head.  It was\r\nthe last conscious movement he was to make upon earth.  Lord John's\r\nrifle #VBD#, and the king sank down, a tangled red #VBG# thing,\r\nupon the ground.",
    "\"#VB# into the thick of them!  Shoot! sonny, shoot!\" cried my\r\ncompanion.",
    "There are strange red depths in the soul of the most commonplace man.\r\nI am #VBN# by nature, and have found my eyes #JJ# many a time\r\nover the scream of a wounded #NN#.  Yet the blood #NN# was on me now.\r\nI found myself on my feet emptying one #NN#, then the other,\r\nclicking open the breech to #NN#, snapping it to again, while\r\ncheering and #VBG# with pure #NN# and joy of #NN# as I did\r\nso.  With our four guns the two of us made a horrible #NN#.  Both the\r\nguards who held Summerlee were down, and he was staggering about like a\r\n#JJ# man in his amazement, unable to realize that he was a free man.\r\nThe dense mob of ape-men ran about in bewilderment, #VBG# whence\r\nthis storm of death was coming or what it might mean.  They waved,\r\n#VBD#, screamed, and #VBD# up over those who had fallen.\r\nThen, with a sudden impulse, they all #VBN# in a howling crowd to the\r\ntrees for shelter, leaving the ground behind them spotted with their\r\nstricken comrades.  The prisoners were left for the moment standing\r\nalone in the middle of the clearing.",
    "Challenger's quick brain had grasped the situation.  He seized the\r\nbewildered Summerlee by the arm, and they both ran towards us.  Two of\r\ntheir guards bounded after them and fell to two #NNS# from Lord John.\r\nWe ran forward into the open to meet our friends, and pressed a loaded\r\nrifle into the hands of each.  But Summerlee was at the end of his\r\nstrength.  He could hardly #VB#.  Already the ape-men were #VBG#\r\nfrom their #NN#.  They were coming through the brushwood and\r\nthreatening to cut us off.  Challenger and I ran Summerlee along, one\r\nat each of his #NNS#, while Lord John covered our retreat, firing\r\nagain and again as savage heads snarled at us out of the bushes.  For a\r\nmile or more the #VBG# brutes were at our very heels.  Then the\r\npursuit #VBD#, for they learned our power and would no longer face\r\nthat #JJ# rifle.  When we had at last reached the camp, we looked\r\nback and found ourselves alone.",
    "So it seemed to us; and yet we were mistaken.  We had hardly closed the\r\n#NN# door of our zareba, clasped each other's hands, and thrown\r\nourselves panting upon the ground beside our spring, when we heard a\r\n#NN# of feet and then a gentle, plaintive crying from outside our\r\nentrance.  Lord Roxton rushed forward, rifle in hand, and threw it\r\nopen.  There, prostrate upon their faces, lay the little red figures of\r\nthe four surviving Indians, trembling with fear of us and yet imploring\r\nour protection.  With an expressive sweep of his hands one of them\r\npointed to the woods around them, and indicated that they were full of\r\ndanger.  Then, darting forward, he threw his arms round Lord John's\r\nlegs, and rested his face upon them.",
    "\"By George!\" cried our #NN#, pulling at his moustache in great\r\nperplexity, \"I #NN# the #NN# are we to do with these people?  Get\r\nup, little #NN#, and take your face off my boots.\"",
    "Summerlee was sitting up and #VBG# some tobacco into his old briar.",
    "\"We've got to see them safe,\" said he.  \"You've pulled us all out of\r\nthe jaws of death.  My word! it was a good bit of work!\"",
    "\"Admirable!\" cried Challenger.  \"Admirable!  Not only we as\r\nindividuals, but European science #RB#, owe you a deep debt of\r\ngratitude for what you have done.  I do not hesitate to say that the\r\ndisappearance of Professor Summerlee and myself would have left an\r\nappreciable gap in modern #JJ# history.  Our young friend here\r\nand you have done most #RB# well.\"",
    "He beamed at us with the old #JJ# smile, but European science would\r\nhave been somewhat amazed could they have seen their chosen child, the\r\nhope of the future, with his tangled, unkempt head, his bare chest, and\r\nhis tattered clothes.  He had one of the #NNS# between his knees,\r\nand sat with a large piece of cold #JJ# #NN# between his\r\nfingers.  The Indian looked up at him, and then, with a little #NN#,\r\n#VBD# to the ground and clung to Lord John's leg.",
    "\"Don't you be scared, my #NN# boy,\" said Lord John, patting the\r\nmatted head in front of him.  \"He can't stick your appearance,\r\nChallenger; and, by George! I don't wonder.  All right, little chap,\r\nhe's only a human, just the same as the rest of us.\"",
    "\"Really, sir!\" cried the Professor.",
    "\"Well, it's lucky for you, Challenger, that you ARE a little out of the\r\nordinary.  If you hadn't been so like the #NN#\"",
    "\"Upon my word, Lord John, you allow yourself great latitude.\"",
    "\"Well, it's a fact.\"",
    "\"I beg, sir, that you will change the subject.  Your remarks are\r\nirrelevant and #JJ#.  The question before us is what are we\r\nto do with these Indians?  The obvious thing is to #NN# them home, if\r\nwe knew where their home was.\"",
    "\"There is no difficulty about that,\" said I.  \"They live in the caves\r\non the other side of the central lake.\"",
    "\"Our young friend here knows where they live.  I gather that it is some\r\ndistance.\"",
    "\"A good twenty miles,\" said I.",
    "Summerlee gave a groan.",
    "\"I, for one, could never get there.  Surely I hear those brutes still\r\nhowling upon our track.\"",
    "As he spoke, from the dark recesses of the woods we heard far away the\r\n#VBG# cry of the ape-men.  The Indians once more set up a feeble\r\nwail of fear.",
    "\"We must move, and move quick!\" said Lord John.  \"You help Summerlee,\r\nyoung fellah.  These Indians will carry stores.  Now, then, come along\r\nbefore they can see us.\"",
    "In less than #NN# we had reached our brushwood retreat and\r\nconcealed ourselves.  All day we heard the excited calling of the\r\nape-men in the direction of our old camp, but none of them came our\r\nway, and the #VBN# fugitives, red and white, had a long, deep sleep.  I\r\nwas #VBG# myself in the evening when someone plucked my sleeve, and I\r\nfound Challenger kneeling beside me.",
    "\"You keep a diary of these events, and you expect eventually to publish\r\nit, Mr. Malone,\" said he, with solemnity.",
    "\"I am only here as a Press reporter,\" I answered.",
    "\"Exactly.  You may have heard some rather fatuous remarks of Lord John\r\nRoxton's which seemed to #RB# that there was #NN#\r\n#NN#\"",
    "\"Yes, I heard them.\"",
    "\"I need not say that any publicity given to such an #NN# levity in\r\nyour narrative of what #NN# be exceedingly offensive to me.\"",
    "\"I will keep well within the truth.\"",
    "\"Lord John's observations are frequently exceedingly fanciful, and he\r\nis capable of #VBG# the most absurd reasons to the respect which\r\nis always shown by the most undeveloped #NNS# to dignity and character.\r\nYou follow my meaning?\"",
    "\"Entirely.\"",
    "\"I leave the matter to your discretion.\"  Then, after a long pause, he\r\nadded:  \"The king of the ape-men was really a creature of great\r\n#NN# most remarkably handsome and intelligent personality.\r\nDid it not strike you?\"",
    "\"A most remarkable creature,\" said I.",
    "And the Professor, much #VBD# in his mind, settled down to his #NN#\r\nonce more.",
    "                           CHAPTER XIV",
    "                \"Those #NN# the Real #NNS#\"",
    "We had imagined that our pursuers, the ape-men, knew nothing of our\r\nbrush-wood hiding-place, but we were soon to find out our mistake.\r\nThere was no sound in the #NN# a #NN# moved upon the trees, and\r\nall was peace around us--but we should have been warned by our first\r\nexperience how #RB# and how patiently these creatures can watch\r\nand wait until their chance comes.  Whatever fate may be mine through\r\nlife, I am very sure that I shall never be nearer death than I was that\r\nmorning.  But I will tell you the thing in its due order.",
    "We all #NN# exhausted after the terrific emotions and scanty food of\r\nyesterday.  Summerlee was still so weak that it was an effort for him\r\nto stand; but the old man was full of a sort of #RB# courage which\r\nwould never admit #NN#.  A council was held, and it was agreed that\r\nwe should wait quietly for an hour or two where we were, have our\r\n#JJ# breakfast, and then make our way across the plateau and\r\nround the central lake to the caves where my observations had shown\r\nthat the Indians lived.  We #VBN# upon the fact that we could #NN#\r\nupon the good word of those whom we had rescued to ensure a warm\r\nwelcome from their fellows.  Then, with our mission accomplished and\r\n#VBG# a #JJR# knowledge of the secrets of Maple White Land, we\r\nshould turn our whole thoughts to the vital problem of our escape and\r\nreturn.  Even Challenger was ready to admit that we should then have\r\ndone all for which we had come, and that our first duty from that time\r\nonwards was to carry back to civilization the amazing discoveries we\r\nhad made.",
    "We were able now to take a more #RB# view of the Indians whom we\r\nhad rescued.  They were small men, wiry, active, and #NN#, with\r\n#NN# black hair tied up in a bunch behind their heads with a #NN#\r\n#NN#, and leathern also were their #NNS#.  Their faces were\r\n#JJ#, well formed, and good-humored.  The #NNS# of their ears,\r\nhanging ragged and bloody, showed that they had been pierced for some\r\nornaments which their #NNS# had torn out.  Their speech, though\r\nunintelligible to us, was fluent among themselves, and as they pointed\r\nto each other and uttered the word \"#NN#\" many times over, we\r\ngathered that this was the name of the nation.  Occasionally, with\r\nfaces which were convulsed with fear and hatred, they shook their\r\nclenched hands at the woods round and cried:  \"#NN#!  Doda!\" which was\r\nsurely their term for their enemies.",
    "\"What do you make of them, Challenger?\" asked Lord John.  \"One thing is\r\nvery clear to me, and that is that the little chap with the front of\r\nhis head #VBN# is a chief among them.\"",
    "It was indeed evident that this man stood apart from the others, and\r\nthat they never ventured to address him without every sign of deep\r\nrespect.  He seemed to be the #JJS# of them all, and yet, so proud\r\nand high was his spirit that, upon Challenger laying his great hand\r\nupon his head, he started like a #VBN# horse and, with a quick flash\r\nof his dark eyes, moved further away from the Professor.  Then, #VBG#\r\nhis hand upon his breast and holding himself with great dignity, he\r\nuttered the word \"#NNS#\" several times.  The Professor, #JJ#,\r\nseized the nearest Indian by the shoulder and proceeded to lecture upon\r\nhim as if he were a #JJ# specimen in a #NN#.",
    "\"The type of these people,\" said he in his sonorous fashion, \"whether\r\njudged by cranial capacity, #JJ# angle, or any other test, cannot be\r\nregarded as a low one; on the contrary, we must place it as\r\nconsiderably higher in the scale than many South American tribes which\r\nI can mention.  On no possible supposition can we explain the evolution\r\nof such a race in this place.  For that matter, so great a gap\r\n#VBZ# these ape-men from the primitive animals which have survived\r\nupon this plateau, that it is #NN# to think that they could\r\nhave developed where we find them.\"",
    "\"Then where the #NN# did they drop from?\" asked Lord John.",
    "\"A question which will, no doubt, be eagerly discussed in every\r\nscientific society in Europe and America,\" the Professor answered.  \"My\r\nown reading of the situation for what it is #NN#\" he #JJ# his\r\nchest enormously and looked #RB# around him at the #NN#\"is\r\nthat evolution has advanced under the peculiar conditions of this\r\ncountry up to the vertebrate stage, the old types surviving and living\r\non in company with the #JJR# ones.  Thus we find such modern creatures\r\nas the #NN# animal with quite a respectable length of\r\n#NN# great deer, and the ant-eater in the #NN# of\r\nreptilian forms of #NN# type.  So much is clear.  And now come the\r\nape-men and the Indian.  What is the scientific mind to think of their\r\npresence?  I can only account for it by an invasion from outside.  It\r\nis probable that there existed an anthropoid ape in South America, who\r\nin past #NNS# found his way to this place, and that he developed into\r\nthe creatures we have seen, some of which\"#NN# he looked hard at\r\n#NN#\"were of an appearance and shape which, if it had been accompanied\r\nby corresponding intelligence, would, I do not hesitate to say, have\r\nreflected credit upon any living race.  As to the Indians I cannot\r\ndoubt that they are more recent #NNS# from below.  Under the\r\n#NN# of #NN# or of #NN# they have made their way up here.\r\n#VBN# by ferocious creatures which they had never before seen, they\r\ntook refuge in the caves which our young friend has described, but they\r\nhave no doubt had a bitter fight to hold their own against wild beasts,\r\nand especially against the ape-men who would #VB# them as #NNS#,\r\nand #NN# a #JJ# war upon them with a cunning which the larger\r\nbeasts would #VB#.  Hence the fact that their numbers appear to be\r\nlimited.  Well, gentlemen, have I read you the #NN# #NN#, or is\r\nthere any point which you would #VB#?\"",
    "Professor Summerlee for once was too depressed to argue, though he\r\nshook his head violently as a token of general #NN#.  Lord John\r\nmerely scratched his scanty #NNS# with the remark that he couldn't put\r\nup a fight as he wasn't in the same weight or class.  For my own part I\r\n#VBN# my usual #NN# of bringing things down to a #RB# prosaic\r\nand practical level by the remark that one of the Indians was missing.",
    "\"He has gone to fetch some water,\" said Lord Roxton.  \"We fitted him up\r\nwith an empty #NN# tin and he is off.\"",
    "\"To the old camp?\" I asked.",
    "\"No, to the brook.  It's among the trees there.  It can't be more than\r\na couple of hundred yards.  But the #NN# is certainly taking his\r\ntime.\"",
    "\"I'll go and look after him,\" said I.  I picked up my rifle and\r\nstrolled in the direction of the brook, leaving my friends to lay out\r\nthe scanty breakfast.  It may seem to you rash that even for so short a\r\ndistance I should #VB# the shelter of our friendly thicket, but you\r\nwill remember that we were many miles from #NN#, that so far as we\r\nknew the creatures had not discovered our retreat, and that in any case\r\nwith a rifle in my hands I had no fear of them.  I had not yet learned\r\ntheir cunning or their strength.",
    "I could hear the murmur of our brook somewhere ahead of me, but there\r\nwas a tangle of trees and brushwood between me and it.  I was making my\r\nway through this at a point which was just out of sight of my\r\ncompanions, when, under one of the trees, I noticed something red\r\nhuddled among the bushes.  As I approached it, I was shocked to see\r\nthat it was the dead body of the missing Indian.  He lay upon his side,\r\nhis limbs drawn up, and his head screwed round at a most unnatural\r\nangle, so that he seemed to be looking straight over his own shoulder.\r\nI gave a cry to warn my friends that something was amiss, and running\r\nforwards I stooped over the body.  Surely my guardian angel was very\r\nnear me then, for some instinct of fear, or it may have been some faint\r\n#NN# of leaves, made me glance upwards.  Out of the thick green\r\nfoliage which hung low over my head, two long #JJ# arms covered\r\nwith reddish hair were slowly descending.  Another instant and the\r\ngreat stealthy hands would have been round my throat.  I sprang\r\nbackwards, but quick as I was, those hands were #JJR# still.  Through\r\nmy sudden spring they missed a fatal grip, but one of them caught the\r\nback of my neck and the other one my face.  I threw my hands up to\r\n#VB# my throat, and the next moment the huge paw had slid down my\r\nface and closed over them.  I was lifted lightly from the ground, and I\r\nfelt an intolerable pressure #VBG# my head back and back until the\r\nstrain upon the #JJ# #NN# was more than I could bear.  My senses\r\nswam, but I still tore at the hand and forced it out from my chin.\r\nLooking up I saw a frightful face with cold #JJ# light blue eyes\r\nlooking down into mine.  There was something hypnotic in those terrible\r\neyes.  I could struggle no longer.  As the creature felt me grow limp\r\nin his grasp, two white #NNS# gleamed for a moment at each side of\r\nthe vile mouth, and the grip #VBD# still more upon my chin, forcing\r\nit always upwards and back.  A thin, #VBN# #NN# formed before my\r\neyes and little silvery bells #VBD# in my ears.  #RB# and far off I\r\nheard the crack of a rifle and was #RB# aware of the shock as I was\r\ndropped to the earth, where I lay without sense or motion.",
    "I #VBD# to find myself on my back upon the grass in our lair within the\r\nthicket.  Someone had brought the water from the brook, and Lord John\r\nwas #VBG# my head with it, while Challenger and Summerlee were\r\n#VBG# me up, with concern in their faces.  For a moment I had a\r\nglimpse of the human spirits behind their scientific #NNS#.  It was\r\nreally shock, rather than any injury, which had #VBN# me, and in\r\nhalf-an-hour, in spite of aching head and stiff neck, I was sitting up\r\nand ready for anything.",
    "\"But you've had the escape of your life, young fellah my lad,\" said\r\nLord Roxton.  \"When I heard your cry and ran forward, and saw your head\r\ntwisted #JJ# and your #NN# #NN#' in the air, I thought we\r\nwere one short.  I missed the beast in my #NN#, but he dropped you\r\nall right and was off like a #NN#.  By George!  I wish I had fifty\r\nmen with rifles.  I'd clear out the whole infernal gang of them and\r\nleave this country a bit cleaner than we found it.\"",
    "It was clear now that the ape-men had in some way marked us down, and\r\nthat we were watched on every side.  We had not so much to fear from\r\nthem during the day, but they would be very likely to rush us by night;\r\nso the sooner we got away from their neighborhood the better.  On three\r\nsides of us was absolute forest, and there we might find ourselves in\r\nan #NN#.  But on the fourth #NN# which sloped down in the\r\ndirection of the #NN# was only low #VB#, with scattered trees\r\nand occasional open glades.  It was, in fact, the route which I had\r\nmyself taken in my solitary journey, and it led us straight for the\r\nIndian caves.  This then must for every reason be our road.",
    "One great regret we had, and that was to leave our old camp behind us,\r\nnot only for the sake of the stores which remained there, but even more\r\nbecause we were #VBG# touch with Zambo, our link with the outside\r\nworld.  However, we had a fair supply of cartridges and all our guns,\r\nso, for a time at least, we could look after ourselves, and we hoped\r\nsoon to have a chance of returning and #VBG# our communications\r\nwith our negro.  He had faithfully promised to stay where he was, and\r\nwe had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word.",
    "It was in the early afternoon that we started upon our journey.  The\r\nyoung chief walked at our head as our guide, but refused indignantly to\r\ncarry any #NN#.  Behind him came the two surviving Indians with our\r\nscanty possessions upon their backs.  We four white men walked in the\r\nrear with rifles loaded and ready.  As we started there broke from the\r\nthick silent woods behind us a sudden great #NN# of the ape-men,\r\nwhich may have been a #NN# of triumph at our departure or a #NN# of\r\ncontempt at our flight.  Looking back we saw only the dense screen of\r\ntrees, but that #NN# yell told us how many of our enemies lurked\r\namong them.  We saw no sign of pursuit, however, and soon we had got\r\ninto more open country and beyond their power.",
    "As I #VBD# along, the #NN# of the four, I could not help smiling\r\nat the appearance of my three companions in front.  Was this the\r\nluxurious Lord John Roxton who had sat that evening in the Albany\r\namidst his Persian #NNS# and his pictures in the pink radiance of the\r\ntinted lights?  And was this the imposing Professor who had swelled\r\nbehind the great desk in his massive study at Enmore Park?  And,\r\nfinally, could this be the austere and prim figure which had risen\r\nbefore the meeting at the Zoological Institute?  No three #VBZ# that\r\none could have met in a Surrey lane could have looked more hopeless and\r\n#JJ#.  We had, it is true, been only a week or so upon the top of\r\nthe plateau, but all our spare clothing was in our camp below, and the\r\none week had been a severe one upon us all, though least to me who had\r\nnot to endure the handling of the ape-men.  My three friends had all\r\nlost their #NNS#, and had now bound #NNS# round their heads,\r\ntheir clothes hung in ribbons about them, and their unshaven #JJ#\r\nfaces were hardly to be recognized.  Both Summerlee and Challenger were\r\n#VBG# heavily, while I still dragged my feet from weakness after the\r\nshock of the morning, and my neck was as stiff as a board from the\r\nmurderous grip that held it.  We were indeed a sorry crew, and I did\r\nnot wonder to see our Indian companions glance back at us occasionally\r\nwith horror and amazement on their faces.",
    "In the late afternoon we reached the margin of the lake, and as we\r\nemerged from the bush and saw the sheet of water stretching before us\r\nour native friends set up a shrill cry of joy and pointed eagerly in\r\nfront of them.  It was indeed a wonderful sight which lay before us.\r\n#VBG# over the glassy surface was a great #NN# of canoes coming\r\nstraight for the shore upon which we stood.  They were some miles out\r\nwhen we first saw them, but they shot forward with great #NN#, and\r\nwere soon so near that the #NNS# could distinguish our persons.\r\nInstantly a #JJ# shout of delight burst from them, and we saw\r\nthem rise from their seats, waving their paddles and spears madly in\r\nthe air.  Then bending to their work once more, they flew across the\r\n#VBG# water, #JJ# their boats upon the sloping sand, and\r\nrushed up to us, #VBG# themselves with loud cries of greeting\r\nbefore the young chief.  Finally one of them, an elderly man, with a\r\n#NN# and #NN# of great #JJ# glass #NNS# and the skin of\r\nsome beautiful #VBN# #VBN# animal slung over his shoulders,\r\nran forward and #VBN# most tenderly the youth whom we had saved.  He\r\nthen looked at us and asked some questions, after which he stepped up\r\nwith much dignity and embraced us also each in turn.  Then, at his\r\norder, the whole tribe lay down upon the ground before us in #NN#.\r\nPersonally I felt shy and #JJ# at this #JJ# #NN#,\r\nand I read the same feeling in the faces of Roxton and Summerlee, but\r\nChallenger #VBN# like a flower in the sun.",
    "\"They may be undeveloped types,\" said he, stroking his beard and\r\nlooking round at them, \"but their #NN# in the presence of their\r\n#NNS# might be a #NN# to some of our more advanced #NNPS#.\r\nStrange how correct are the instincts of the natural man!\"",
    "It was clear that the natives had come out upon the #NN#, for every\r\nman carried his #NN# long bamboo #VBD# with #NNS# bow and\r\narrows, and some sort of club or stone #NN# slung at his side.\r\nTheir dark, angry #NNS# at the woods from which we had come, and the\r\nfrequent #NN# of the word \"Doda,\" made it clear enough that this\r\nwas a rescue party who had set forth to save or revenge the old chief's\r\nson, for such we gathered that the youth must be.  A council was now\r\nheld by the whole tribe squatting in a circle, whilst we sat near on a\r\nslab of basalt and watched their proceedings.  Two or three #NNS#\r\nspoke, and finally our young friend made a #JJ# #NN# with such\r\n#JJ# features and #NNS# that we could understand it all as\r\nclearly as if we had known his language.",
    "\"What is the use of returning?\" he said.  \"#RB# or later the thing\r\nmust be done.  Your comrades have been murdered.  What if I have\r\nreturned safe?  These others have been done to death.  There is no\r\nsafety for any of us.  We are assembled now and ready.\" Then he pointed\r\nto us.  \"These strange men are our friends.  They are great #NNS#,\r\nand they hate the ape-men even as we do.  They command,\" here he\r\npointed up to heaven, \"the thunder and the #VBG#.  When shall we\r\nhave such a chance again?  Let us go forward, and either die now or\r\nlive for the future in safety.  How else shall we go back #VBN# to\r\nour women?\"",
    "The little red warriors hung upon the words of the speaker, and when he\r\nhad finished they burst into a roar of applause, waving their #JJ#\r\nweapons in the air.  The old chief stepped forward to us, and asked us\r\nsome questions, pointing at the same time to the woods.  Lord John made\r\na sign to him that he should wait for an answer and then he turned to\r\nus.",
    "\"Well, it's up to you to say what you will do,\" said he; \"for my part I\r\nhave a score to settle with these #NN#, and if it ends by wiping\r\nthem off the face of the earth I don't see that the earth need fret\r\nabout it.  I'm goin' with our little red #NNS# and I mean to see them\r\nthrough the scrap.  What do you say, young fellah?\"",
    "\"Of course I will come.\"",
    "\"And you, Challenger?\"",
    "\"I will assuredly #NN#.\"",
    "\"And you, Summerlee?\"",
    "\"We seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition,\r\nLord John.  I assure you that I little thought when I left my\r\nprofessional chair in London that it was for the purpose of heading a\r\n#NN# of savages upon a #NN# of anthropoid apes.\"",
    "\"To such base #VBZ# do we come,\" said Lord John, smiling.  \"But we are\r\nup against it, so what's the decision?\"",
    "\"It seems a most #JJ# step,\" said Summerlee, argumentative to\r\nthe last, \"but if you are all going, I hardly see how I can remain\r\nbehind.\"",
    "\"Then it is settled,\" said Lord John, and turning to the chief he\r\nnodded and slapped his rifle.",
    "The old fellow clasped our hands, each in turn, while his men cheered\r\nlouder than ever.  It was too late to advance that night, so the\r\nIndians settled down into a rude #NN#.  On all sides their fires\r\nbegan to glimmer and smoke.  Some of them who had disappeared into the\r\njungle came back presently driving a young iguanodon before them.  Like\r\nthe others, it had a #NN# of asphalt upon its shoulder, and it was only\r\nwhen we saw one of the natives step forward with the air of an owner\r\nand give his consent to the beast's slaughter that we understood at\r\nlast that these great creatures were as much private property as a herd\r\nof cattle, and that these #NNS# which had so #JJ# us were\r\nnothing more than the marks of the owner.  #NNP#, #JJ#, and\r\nvegetarian, with great limbs but a minute brain, they could be rounded\r\nup and driven by a child.  In a few minutes the huge beast had been cut\r\nup and slabs of him were hanging over a dozen camp fires, together with\r\ngreat scaly #NN# fish which had been #VBD# in the lake.",
    "Summerlee had lain down and slept upon the sand, but we others roamed\r\nround the edge of the water, seeking to learn something more of this\r\nstrange country.  Twice we found #NNS# of blue clay, such as we had\r\nalready seen in the swamp of the pterodactyls.  These were old volcanic\r\n#NNS#, and for some reason excited the greatest interest in Lord John.\r\nWhat attracted Challenger, on the other hand, was a bubbling, gurgling\r\nmud #NN#, where some strange gas formed great bursting #NNS# upon\r\nthe surface.  He thrust a hollow reed into it and cried out with\r\ndelight like a #NN# then he was able, on touching it with a\r\n#VBN# match, to cause a sharp explosion and a blue flame at the far\r\nend of the tube.  Still more pleased was he when, #VBG# a leathern\r\npouch over the end of the reed, and so filling it with the gas, he was\r\nable to send it soaring up into the air.",
    "\"An #NN# gas, and one #RB# lighter than the atmosphere.  I\r\nshould say beyond doubt that it contained a considerable proportion of\r\nfree #NN#.  The resources of G. E. C. are not yet exhausted, my\r\nyoung friend.  I may yet show you how a great mind #NNS# all Nature to\r\nits use.\" He swelled with some secret purpose, but would say no more.",
    "There was nothing which we could see upon the shore which seemed to me\r\nso wonderful as the great sheet of water before us.  Our numbers and\r\nour noise had frightened all living creatures away, and save for a few\r\npterodactyls, which soared round high above our heads while they waited\r\nfor the carrion, all was still around the camp.  But it was different\r\nout upon the rose-tinted waters of the central lake.  It #VBN# and\r\nheaved with strange life.  Great slate-colored backs and high serrated\r\n#JJ# #NNS# shot up with a fringe of silver, and then rolled down into\r\nthe depths again.  The #NN# far out were spotted with uncouth\r\ncrawling forms, huge #NNS#, strange saurians, and one great flat\r\ncreature like a writhing, palpitating #NN# of black greasy leather,\r\nwhich #VBD# its way slowly to the lake.  Here and there high #NN#\r\nheads projected out of the water, cutting swiftly through it with a\r\nlittle collar of #NN# in front, and a long #VBG# #NN# behind, rising\r\nand falling in graceful, #NN# #NNS# as they went.  It was\r\nnot until one of these creatures wriggled on to a sand-bank within a\r\nfew hundred yards of us, and exposed a #VBN# body and huge\r\n#NNS# behind the long serpent neck, that Challenger, and Summerlee,\r\nwho had joined us, broke out into their duet of wonder and admiration.",
    "\"#NN#!  A #NN# #NN#!\" cried Summerlee.  \"That I\r\nshould have lived to see such a sight!  We are blessed, my dear\r\nChallenger, above all #NN# since the world began!\"",
    "It was not until the night had fallen, and the fires of our savage\r\nallies glowed red in the shadows, that our two men of science could be\r\ndragged away from the #NN# of that primeval lake.  Even in the\r\ndarkness as we lay upon the #NN#, we heard from time to time the\r\nsnort and #NN# of the huge creatures who lived #RB#.",
    "At earliest dawn our camp was #JJ# and an hour later we had started\r\nupon our memorable expedition.  Often in my dreams have I thought that\r\nI might live to be a war correspondent.  In what wildest one could I\r\nhave conceived the nature of the campaign which it should be my lot to\r\nreport!  Here then is my first #NN# from a field of battle:",
    "Our numbers had been #VBN# during the night by a fresh #NN# of\r\nnatives from the caves, and we may have been four or five hundred\r\nstrong when we made our advance.  A fringe of #NNS# was thrown out in\r\nfront, and behind them the whole force in a solid column made their way\r\nup the long slope of the bush country until we were near the edge of\r\nthe forest.  Here they spread out into a long straggling line of\r\n#NN# and #NN#.  Roxton and Summerlee took their position upon the\r\nright #NN#, while Challenger and I were on the left.  It was a host of\r\nthe stone age that we were #VBG# to #NN# with the last\r\nword of the #NN#'s art from St. James' Street and the #NNP#.",
    "We had not long to wait for our enemy.  A wild shrill clamor rose from\r\nthe edge of the wood and suddenly a body of ape-men rushed out with\r\n#NNS# and stones, and made for the center of the Indian line.  It was a\r\n#JJ# move but a foolish one, for the great bandy-legged creatures\r\nwere slow of foot, while their opponents were as active as #NNS#.  It\r\nwas horrible to see the fierce brutes with #VBG# mouths and glaring\r\neyes, rushing and grasping, but forever missing their #JJ# enemies,\r\nwhile arrow after arrow buried itself in their hides.  One great fellow\r\nran past me roaring with pain, with a dozen #NNS# sticking from his\r\nchest and ribs.  In mercy I put a bullet through his skull, and he fell\r\nsprawling among the #NNS#.  But this was the only shot fired, for the\r\nattack had been on the center of the line, and the Indians there had\r\nneeded no help of ours in #VBG# it.  Of all the ape-men who had\r\nrushed out into the open, I do not think that one got back to cover.",
    "But the matter was more deadly when we came among the trees.  For an\r\nhour or more after we entered the wood, there was a desperate struggle\r\nin which for a time we hardly held our own.  #VBG# out from among\r\nthe scrub the ape-men with huge clubs broke in upon the Indians and\r\noften #VBN# three or four of them before they could be speared.  Their\r\nfrightful blows shattered everything upon which they fell.  One of them\r\nknocked Summerlee's rifle to matchwood and the next would have crushed\r\nhis skull had an Indian not stabbed the beast to the heart.  Other\r\nape-men in the trees above us #VBD# down stones and #NNS# of wood,\r\noccasionally dropping #RB# on to our #NNS# and #VBG# furiously\r\nuntil they were felled.  Once our allies broke under the pressure, and\r\nhad it not been for the execution done by our rifles they would\r\ncertainly have taken to their heels.  But they were #RB# #VBD#\r\nby their old chief and came on with such a rush that the ape-men began\r\nin turn to give way.  Summerlee was #NN#, but I was emptying my\r\nmagazine as quick as I could fire, and on the further flank we heard\r\nthe continuous #VBG# of our companion's rifles.",
    "Then in a moment came the panic and the #NN#.  #VBG# and\r\nhowling, the great creatures rushed away in all directions through the\r\nbrushwood, while our allies yelled in their savage delight, following\r\nswiftly after their flying enemies.  All the feuds of #JJ#\r\ngenerations, all the #NNS# and #NNS# of their narrow history, all\r\nthe memories of #NN# and #NN# were to be #VBN# that day.\r\nAt last man was to be supreme and the #NN# to find forever his\r\n#VBN# place.  #RB# as they would the fugitives were too slow to\r\nescape from the active savages, and from every side in the tangled\r\nwoods we heard the #NN# #VBZ#, the #VBG# of #NNS#, and the crash\r\nand thud as ape-men were brought down from their #NNS# in the\r\ntrees.",
    "I was following the others, when I found that Lord John and Challenger\r\nhad come across to join us.",
    "\"It's over,\" said Lord John.  \"I think we can leave the tidying up to\r\nthem.  Perhaps the less we see of it the better we shall sleep.\"",
    "Challenger's eyes were shining with the lust of slaughter.",
    "\"We have been privileged,\" he cried, #VBG# about like a #NN#,\r\n\"to be present at one of the typical #JJ# battles of #NN#\r\nbattles which have determined the fate of the world.  What, my friends,\r\nis the conquest of one nation by another?  It is #JJ#.  Each\r\nproduces the same result.  But those fierce #NNS#, when in the dawn of\r\nthe ages the #NNS# held their own against the tiger folk, or\r\nthe elephants first found that they had a master, those were the real\r\n#NN# #NNS# that count.  By this strange turn of fate we\r\nhave seen and helped to decide even such a #NN#.  Now upon this\r\nplateau the future must ever be for man.\"",
    "It needed a robust #NN# in the end to justify such tragic means.  As\r\nwe advanced together through the woods we found the ape-men lying\r\nthick, transfixed with spears or arrows.  Here and there a little group\r\nof shattered Indians marked where one of the #NNS# had turned to\r\nbay, and sold his life #RB#.  #RB# in front of us we heard the\r\nyelling and roaring which showed the direction of the pursuit.  The\r\nape-men had been driven back to their #NN#, they had made a last stand\r\nthere, once again they had been broken, and now we were in time to see\r\nthe final fearful scene of all.  Some #NN# or a hundred males, the\r\nlast #NNS#, had been driven across that same little clearing which\r\nled to the edge of the cliff, the scene of our own exploit two days\r\nbefore.  As we arrived the Indians, a semicircle of spearmen, had\r\nclosed in on them, and in a minute it was over, #NN# or forty died\r\nwhere they stood.  The others, screaming and #VBG#, were thrust over\r\nthe precipice, and went #VBG# down, as their prisoners had of old,\r\non to the sharp bamboos six hundred feet below.  It was as Challenger\r\nhad said, and the reign of man was assured forever in Maple White Land.\r\nThe males were #VBN#, #NNP# #NNP# was destroyed, the females and\r\nyoung were driven away to live in #NN#, and the long #NN# of\r\n#JJ# #NNS# had reached its bloody end.",
    "For us the victory brought much advantage.  Once again we were able to\r\nvisit our camp and get at our stores.  Once more also we were able to\r\ncommunicate with Zambo, who had been terrified by the spectacle from\r\nafar of an #NN# of apes falling from the edge of the cliff.",
    "\"Come away, #NN#, come away!\" he cried, his eyes starting from his\r\nhead.  \"The #NN# get you sure if you stay up there.\"",
    "\"It is the voice of sanity!\" said Summerlee with conviction.  \"We have\r\nhad adventures enough and they are neither #JJ# to our character or\r\nour position.  I hold you to your word, Challenger.  From now  onwards\r\nyou devote your #NNS# to getting us out of this horrible country and\r\nback once more to civilization.\"",
    "                            CHAPTER XV",
    "                \"Our #NNP# have seen Great #NNS#\"",
    "I write this from day to day, but I trust that before I come to the end\r\nof it, I may be able to say that the light #VBZ#, at last, through our\r\nclouds.  We are held here with no clear means of making our escape, and\r\nbitterly we #VBP# against it. Yet, I can well imagine that the day may\r\ncome when we may be glad that we were kept, against our will, to see\r\nsomething more of the wonders of this singular place, and of the\r\ncreatures who inhabit it.",
    "The victory of the Indians and the #NN# of the ape-men, marked\r\nthe turning point of our #NNS#.  From then onwards, we were in truth\r\nmasters of the plateau, for the natives looked upon us with a mixture\r\nof fear and gratitude, since by our strange powers we had aided them to\r\ndestroy their #JJ# foe.  For their own #NN# they would, perhaps,\r\nbe glad to see the departure of such formidable and #JJ#\r\npeople, but they have not themselves suggested any way by which we may\r\nreach the #NNS# below.  There had been, so far as we could follow\r\ntheir signs, a tunnel by which the place could be approached, the lower\r\nexit of which we had seen from below.  By this, no doubt, both ape-men\r\nand Indians had at different epochs reached the top, and Maple White\r\nwith his companion had taken the same way.  Only the year before,\r\nhowever, there had been a terrific #NN#, and the upper end of the\r\ntunnel had fallen in and #RB# disappeared.  The Indians now could\r\nonly shake their heads and #VB# their shoulders when we expressed by\r\nsigns our desire to descend.  It may be that they cannot, but it may\r\nalso be that they will not, help us to get away.",
    "At the end of the #JJ# campaign the surviving #NN# were\r\ndriven across the plateau (their #NNS# were horrible) and\r\nestablished in the neighborhood of the Indian caves, where they would,\r\nfrom now onwards, be a #JJ# race under the eyes of their masters.\r\nIt was a rude, raw, primeval version of the #NNPS# in #NNP# or the\r\n#NNPS# in Egypt.  At night we could hear from amid the trees the\r\nlong-drawn cry, as some primitive #NNP# #VBD# for fallen greatness\r\nand recalled the #VBN# glories of Ape Town.  #NNS# of wood and\r\n#NNS# of water, such were they from now onwards.",
    "We had returned across the plateau with our allies two days after the\r\nbattle, and made our camp at the foot of their cliffs.  They would have\r\nhad us share their caves with them, but Lord John would by no means\r\nconsent to it considering that to do so would put us in their power if\r\nthey were #RB# #VBN#.  We kept our #NN#, therefore,\r\nand had our weapons ready for any #NN#, while preserving the most\r\nfriendly relations.  We also continually visited their caves, which\r\nwere most remarkable places, though whether made by man or by Nature we\r\nhave never been able to determine.  They were all on the one #NN#,\r\n#VBN# out of some soft rock which lay between the volcanic basalt\r\nforming the ruddy cliffs above them, and the hard granite which formed\r\ntheir base.",
    "The openings were about eighty feet above the ground, and were led up\r\nto by long stone stairs, so narrow and steep that no large animal could\r\n#VB# them.  Inside they were warm and dry, running in straight\r\n#NNS# of varying length into the side of the hill, with smooth gray\r\nwalls #VBN# with many excellent pictures done with charred sticks\r\nand representing the various animals of the plateau.  If every living\r\nthing were swept from the country the future explorer would find upon\r\nthe walls of these caves ample evidence of the strange #NN#\r\ndinosaurs, iguanodons, and fish #NN# had lived so recently\r\nupon earth.",
    "Since we had learned that the huge iguanodons were kept as #JJ# #NNS#\r\nby their #NNS#, and were simply walking #NN#, we had conceived\r\nthat man, even with his primitive weapons, had established his\r\n#NN# upon the plateau.  We were soon to discover that it was not\r\nso, and that he was still there upon #NN#.",
    "It was on the third day after our forming our camp near the Indian\r\ncaves that the tragedy occurred.  Challenger and Summerlee had gone off\r\ntogether that day to the lake where some of the natives, under their\r\ndirection, were engaged in #VBG# specimens of the great #NNS#.\r\nLord John and I had remained in our camp, while a number of the Indians\r\nwere scattered about upon the grassy slope in front of the caves\r\nengaged in different ways.  Suddenly there was a shrill cry of alarm,\r\nwith the word \"#NN#\" resounding from a hundred tongues.  From every\r\nside men, women, and children were rushing wildly for shelter, swarming\r\nup the #NNS# and into the caves in a mad #NN#.",
    "Looking up, we could see them waving their arms from the rocks above\r\nand #VBG# to us to join them in their refuge.  We had both seized\r\nour magazine rifles and ran out to see what the danger could be.\r\nSuddenly from the near belt of trees there broke forth a group of\r\ntwelve or fifteen Indians, running for their lives, and at their very\r\nheels two of those frightful monsters which had disturbed our camp and\r\npursued me upon my solitary journey.  In shape they were like horrible\r\n#NNS#, and moved in a succession of springs, but in size they were of\r\nan incredible bulk, larger than the largest elephant.  We had never\r\nbefore seen them save at night,  and indeed they are nocturnal animals\r\nsave when disturbed in their #NNS#, as these had been.  We now stood\r\namazed at the sight, for their blotched and warty skins were of a\r\ncurious #NN# #NN#, and the sunlight struck them with an\r\n#VBG# #NN# #NN# as they moved.",
    "We had little time to watch them, however, for in an instant they had\r\novertaken the fugitives and were making a #JJ# slaughter among them.\r\nTheir method was to fall forward with their full weight upon each in\r\nturn, leaving him crushed and #JJ#, to bound on after the others.\r\nThe wretched Indians screamed with terror, but were helpless, run as\r\nthey would, before the #JJ# purpose and horrible activity of\r\nthese monstrous creatures.  One after another they went down, and there\r\nwere not #NN# surviving by the time my companion and I could\r\ncome to their help.  But our aid was of little avail and only involved\r\nus in the same peril.  At the #NN# of a couple of hundred yards we\r\n#VBN# our #NNS#, firing bullet after bullet into the beasts, but\r\nwith no more effect than if we were #JJ# them with #NNS# of paper.\r\nTheir slow reptilian #NNS# cared nothing for #NNS#, and the springs\r\nof their lives, with no special brain center but scattered throughout\r\ntheir #JJ# #NNS#, could not be tapped by any modern weapons.  The\r\nmost that we could do was to check their progress by distracting their\r\nattention with the flash and roar of our guns, and so to give both the\r\nnatives and ourselves time to reach the steps which led to safety.  But\r\nwhere the conical explosive bullets of the twentieth century were of no\r\navail, the #VBN# arrows of the natives, dipped in the juice of\r\n#NN# and steeped afterwards in #JJ# carrion, could succeed.\r\nSuch arrows were of little avail to the hunter who attacked the beast,\r\nbecause their action in that torpid circulation was slow, and before\r\nits powers failed it could certainly overtake and #NN# its assailant.\r\nBut now, as the two monsters #VBD# us to the very foot of the stairs,\r\na #NN# of darts came whistling from every #NN# in the cliff above\r\nthem.  In a minute they were #JJ# with them, and yet with no sign\r\nof pain they clawed and #VBN# with #JJ# rage at the steps which\r\nwould lead them to their victims, mounting clumsily up for a few yards\r\nand then sliding down again to the ground.  But at last the poison\r\nworked.  One of them gave a deep rumbling groan and dropped his huge\r\nsquat head on to the earth.  The other bounded round in an #JJ#\r\ncircle with shrill, #VBG# cries, and then lying down #VBD# in agony\r\nfor some minutes before it also stiffened and lay still.  With yells of\r\ntriumph the Indians came #VBG# down from their caves and #NN#d a\r\n#JJ# dance of victory round the dead bodies, in mad joy that two\r\nmore of the most dangerous of all their enemies had been #VBN#.  That\r\nnight they cut up and removed the bodies, not to #NN# the poison\r\nwas still #NN# lest they should #VBN# a #NN#.  The great\r\nreptilian hearts, however, each as large as a #NN#, still lay there,\r\nbeating slowly and steadily, with a gentle rise and fall, in horrible\r\nindependent life.  It was only upon the third day that the #NN# ran\r\ndown and the dreadful things were still.",
    "Some day, when I have a better desk than a #NN# and more helpful\r\ntools than a worn stub of pencil and a last, tattered note-book, I will\r\nwrite some fuller account of the Accala #NN# our life amongst\r\nthem, and of the glimpses which we had of the strange conditions of\r\n#JJ# Maple White Land.  #NN#, at least, will never fail me, for\r\nso long as the breath of life is in me, every hour and every action of\r\nthat period will stand out as hard and clear as do the first strange\r\nhappenings of our childhood.  No new impressions could #NN# those\r\nwhich are so deeply cut.  When the time comes I will describe that\r\nwondrous moonlit night upon the great lake when a young\r\n#NN# strange creature, half seal, half fish, to look at,\r\nwith #VBN# eyes on each side of his #NN#, and a third eye fixed\r\nupon the top of his #NNS# #JJ# in an Indian #JJ#, and nearly\r\nupset our canoe before we #VBD# it ashore; the same night that a green\r\n#NN# shot out from the rushes and carried off in its coils the\r\n#NN# of Challenger's canoe.  I will tell, too, of the great\r\nnocturnal white #NN# this day we do not know whether it was beast\r\nor #NN# lived in a vile swamp to the east of the lake, and\r\n#VBN# about with a faint #JJ# glimmer in the darkness.  The\r\nIndians were so terrified at it that they would not go near the place,\r\nand, though we twice made expeditions and saw it each time, we could\r\nnot make our way through the deep marsh in which it lived.  I can only\r\nsay that it seemed to be larger than a #NN# and had the #JJS# musky\r\nodor.  I will tell also of the huge bird which #VBN# Challenger to the\r\nshelter of the rocks one day--a great running bird, far taller than an\r\nostrich, with a #JJ# neck and cruel head which made it a\r\nwalking death.  As Challenger climbed to safety one dart of that savage\r\ncurving beak shore off the heel of his boot as if it had been cut with\r\na chisel.  This time at least modern weapons #VBD# and the great\r\ncreature, twelve feet from head to #NNS# its name,\r\naccording to our panting but exultant #NN# down before Lord\r\nRoxton's rifle in a flurry of waving feathers and #VBG# limbs, with\r\ntwo #JJ# yellow eyes glaring up from the midst of it.  May I\r\nlive to see that flattened vicious skull in its own #NN# amid the\r\ntrophies of the Albany.  Finally, I will assuredly give some account of\r\nthe #NN#, the giant #JJ# #NN# pig, with projecting chisel\r\nteeth, which we killed as it drank in the gray of the morning by the\r\nside of the lake.",
    "All this I shall some day write at fuller length, and amidst these more\r\nstirring days I would tenderly sketch in these lovely summer evenings,\r\nwhen with the deep blue sky above us we lay in good comradeship among\r\nthe long grasses by the wood and #VBD# at the strange fowl that\r\nswept over us and the quaint new creatures which crept from their\r\n#NNS# to watch us, while above us the boughs of the bushes were heavy\r\nwith #JJ# fruit, and below us strange and lovely flowers peeped at\r\nus from among the #NN#; or those long moonlit nights when we lay out\r\nupon the shimmering surface of the great lake and watched with wonder\r\nand awe the huge circles rippling out from the sudden splash of some\r\nfantastic monster; or the greenish gleam, far down in the deep water,\r\nof some strange creature upon the #NNS# of darkness.  These are the\r\n#NNS# which my mind and my pen will #VBP# upon in every detail at some\r\nfuture day.",
    "But, you will ask, why these experiences and why this delay, when you\r\nand your comrades should have been occupied day and night in the\r\n#VBG# of some means by which you could return to the outer world?\r\nMy answer is, that there was not one of us who was not working for this\r\nend, but that our work had been in vain.  One fact we had very #RB#\r\ndiscovered:  The Indians would do nothing to help us.  In every other\r\nway they were our #NN# might almost say our devoted #NN#\r\nwhen it was suggested that they should help us to make and carry a\r\nplank which would #VB# the chasm, or when we wished to get from them\r\n#NNS# of leather or #NN# to #VB# ropes which might help us, we were\r\nmet by a good-humored, but an invincible, #JJ#.  They would #VB#,\r\ntwinkle their eyes, shake their heads, and there was the end of it.\r\nEven the old chief met us with the same obstinate denial, and it was\r\nonly Maretas, the youngster whom we had saved, who looked #RB# at\r\nus and told us by his gestures that he was #VBN# for our #VBN#\r\nwishes.  Ever since their #JJ# triumph with the ape-men they looked\r\nupon us as #NN#, who bore victory in the #NNS# of strange weapons,\r\nand they believed that so long as we remained with them good fortune\r\nwould be theirs.  A little #NN# wife and a cave of our own were\r\nfreely offered to each of us if we would but forget our own people and\r\ndwell forever upon the plateau.  So far all had been kindly, however\r\nfar apart our desires might be; but we felt well assured that our\r\nactual plans of a descent must be kept secret, for we had reason to\r\nfear that at the last they might try to hold us by force.",
    "In spite of the danger from dinosaurs (which is not great save at\r\nnight, for, as I may have said before, they are mostly nocturnal in\r\ntheir habits) I have twice in the last three weeks been over to our old\r\ncamp in order to see our negro who still kept watch and #NN# below the\r\ncliff.  My eyes strained eagerly across the great plain in the hope of\r\nseeing afar off the help for which we had #VBD#.  But the long\r\n#NN# #NNS# still stretched away, empty and bare, to the\r\ndistant line of the cane-brake.",
    "\"They will soon come now, Massa Malone.  Before another week pass\r\nIndian come back and bring rope and fetch you down.\"  Such was the\r\ncheery cry of our excellent Zambo.",
    "I had one strange experience as I came from this second visit which had\r\ninvolved my being away for a night from my companions.  I was returning\r\nalong the #VBN# route, and had reached a spot within a mile\r\nor so of the marsh of the pterodactyls, when I saw an extraordinary\r\nobject approaching me.  It was a man who walked inside a framework made\r\nof bent canes so that he was enclosed on all sides in a #VBN#\r\ncage.  As I drew nearer I was more amazed still to see that it was Lord\r\nJohn Roxton.  When he saw me he slipped from under his curious\r\nprotection and came towards me laughing, and yet, as I thought, with\r\nsome confusion in his manner.",
    "\"Well, young fellah,\" said he, \"who would have thought of #NN#' you\r\nup here?\"",
    "\"What in the world are you doing?\" I asked.",
    "\"#NN#' my friends, the pterodactyls,\" said  he.",
    "\"#NN#' beasts, don't you think?  But #NN#!  #JJ# rude ways\r\nwith #NNS#, as you may remember.  So I #VBN# this framework which\r\nkeeps them from bein' too #NN#' in their #NNS#.\"",
    "\"But what do you want in the swamp?\"",
    "He looked at me with a very questioning eye, and I read hesitation in\r\nhis face.",
    "\"Don't you think other people besides Professors can want to know\r\nthings?\" he said at last.  \"I'm #NN#' the pretty #NNS#.  That's\r\nenough for you.\"",
    "\"No #NN#,\" said I.",
    "His #NN# returned and he laughed.",
    "\"No offense, young fellah.  I'm goin' to get a young devil #NN# for\r\nChallenger.  That's one of my #NNS#.  No, I don't want your company.\r\nI'm safe in this cage, and you are not.  So long, and I'll be back in\r\ncamp by #NN#.\"",
    "He turned away and I left him wandering on through the wood with his\r\nextraordinary cage around him.",
    "If Lord John's behavior at this time was strange, that of Challenger\r\nwas more so.  I may say that he seemed to possess an extraordinary\r\nfascination for the Indian women, and that he always carried a large\r\nspreading palm branch with which he beat them off as if they were\r\n#VBZ#, when their attentions became too pressing.  To see him walking\r\nlike a #JJ# #NN# #NNP#, with this #NN# of authority in his hand,\r\nhis black beard bristling in front of him, his toes pointing at each\r\nstep, and a train of #JJ# Indian #NNS# behind him, clad in their\r\n#JJ# #NN# of bark #NN#, is one of the most grotesque of all the\r\npictures which I will carry back with me.  As to Summerlee, he was\r\nabsorbed in the insect and bird life of the plateau, and spent his\r\nwhole time (save that considerable portion which was devoted to #VBG#\r\nChallenger for not getting us out of our difficulties) in #VBG# and\r\nmounting his specimens.",
    "Challenger had been in the habit of walking off by himself every\r\nmorning and returning from time to time with looks of #JJ#\r\nsolemnity, as one who bears the full weight of a great enterprise upon\r\nhis shoulders.  One day, palm branch in hand, and his crowd of #VBG#\r\n#NNS# behind him, he led us down to his hidden #NN# and took us\r\ninto the secret of his plans.",
    "The place was a small clearing in the center of a palm grove.  In this\r\nwas one of those boiling mud #NNS# which I have already described.\r\n#IN# its edge were scattered a number of leathern thongs cut from\r\niguanodon hide, and a large #VBD# membrane which proved to be the\r\ndried and scraped stomach of one of the great fish lizards from the\r\nlake.  This huge #NN# had been #VBN# up at one end and only a small\r\n#NN# left at the other.  Into this opening several bamboo canes had\r\nbeen #VBN# and the other ends of these canes were in contact with\r\nconical clay #NNS# which collected the gas bubbling up through the\r\nmud of the geyser.  Soon the #JJ# organ began to slowly #VB# and\r\nshow such a tendency to upward movements that Challenger fastened the\r\ncords which held it to the trunks of the surrounding trees.  In half an\r\nhour a good-sized #NN# had been formed, and the jerking and\r\nstraining upon the thongs showed that it was capable of considerable\r\nlift.  Challenger, like a glad father in the presence of his\r\n#NN#, stood smiling and stroking his beard, in silent,\r\n#VBN# content as he gazed at the creation of his brain.  It\r\nwas Summerlee who first broke the silence.",
    "\"You don't mean us to go up in that thing, Challenger?\" said he, in an\r\nacid voice.",
    "\"I mean, my dear Summerlee, to give you such a demonstration of its\r\npowers that after seeing it you will, I am sure, have no hesitation in\r\ntrusting yourself to it.\"",
    "\"You can put it right out of your head now, at once,\" said Summerlee\r\nwith decision, \"nothing on earth would #VB# me to commit such a\r\nfolly.  Lord John, I trust that you will not #NN# such madness?\"",
    "\"#VBN# #JJ#, I call it,\" said our peer.  \"I'd like to see how it\r\n#NNS#.\"",
    "\"So you shall,\" said Challenger.  \"For some days I have exerted my\r\nwhole brain force upon the problem of how we shall descend from these\r\ncliffs.  We have satisfied ourselves that we cannot climb down and that\r\nthere is no tunnel.  We are also unable to construct any kind of bridge\r\nwhich may take us back to the pinnacle from which we came.  How then\r\nshall I find a means to convey us?  Some little time ago I had remarked\r\nto our young friend here that free hydrogen was #VBN# from the\r\ngeyser.  The idea of a balloon naturally followed.  I was, I will\r\nadmit, somewhat #VBN# by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to\r\n#VB# the gas, but the #NN# of the immense #NNS# of these\r\nreptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem.  Behold the\r\nresult!\"",
    "He put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and pointed #RB#\r\nwith the other.",
    "By this time the gas-bag had swollen to a #RB# #NN# and was\r\njerking strongly upon its #NNS#.",
    "\"#NN# madness!\" snorted Summerlee.",
    "Lord John was delighted with the whole idea.  \"#JJ# old dear, ain't\r\nhe?\" he whispered to me, and then louder to Challenger.  \"What about a\r\ncar?\"",
    "\"The car will be my next care.  I have already planned how it is to be\r\nmade and attached.  Meanwhile I will simply show you how capable my\r\n#NNS# is of #VBG# the weight of each of us.\"",
    "\"All of us, surely?\"",
    "\"No, it is part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in a\r\n#NN#, and the balloon be drawn back by means which I shall have no\r\ndifficulty in #VBG#.  If it will support the weight of one and let\r\nhim gently down, it will have done all that is required of it.  I will\r\nnow show you its capacity in that direction.\"",
    "He brought out a lump of basalt of a considerable size, constructed in\r\nthe middle so that a cord could be easily attached to it.  This cord\r\nwas the one which we had brought with us on to the plateau after we had\r\nused it for climbing the pinnacle.  It was over a hundred feet long,\r\nand though it was thin it was very strong.  He had prepared a sort of\r\ncollar of leather with many #NNS# depending from it.  This collar was\r\nplaced over the #NN# of the balloon, and the hanging thongs were\r\ngathered together below, so that the pressure of any weight would be\r\n#VBN# over a considerable surface.  Then the lump of basalt was\r\nfastened to the thongs, and the rope was allowed to hang from the end\r\nof it, being passed three times round the Professor's arm.",
    "\"I will now,\" said Challenger, with a smile of pleased anticipation,\r\n\"demonstrate the carrying power of my balloon.\" As he said so he cut\r\nwith a knife the various lashings that held it.",
    "Never was our expedition in more imminent danger of complete\r\nannihilation.  The inflated membrane shot up with frightful #NN#\r\ninto the air.  In an instant Challenger was pulled off his feet and\r\ndragged after it.  I had just time to throw my arms round his ascending\r\n#NN# when I was myself whipped up into the air.  Lord John had me with\r\na rat-trap grip round the legs, but I felt that he also was coming off\r\nthe ground.  For a moment I had a vision of four #NNS# #VBG#\r\nlike a string of #NNS# over the land that they had explored.  But,\r\n#RB#, there were limits to the strain which the rope would stand,\r\nthough none apparently to the lifting powers of this infernal #NN#.\r\nThere was a sharp crack, and we were in a heap upon the ground with\r\ncoils of rope all over us.  When we were able to #VB# to our feet we\r\nsaw far off in the deep blue sky one dark spot where the lump of basalt\r\nwas #VBG# upon its way.",
    "\"Splendid!\" cried the #JJ# Challenger, rubbing his injured arm.\r\n\"A most #JJ# and #JJ# demonstration!  I could not have\r\n#VBN# such a success.  Within a week, gentlemen, I promise that a\r\nsecond balloon will be prepared, and that you can count upon taking in\r\nsafety and comfort the first stage of our homeward journey.\" So far I\r\nhave written each of the #VBG# events as it occurred.  Now I am\r\nrounding off my narrative from the old camp, where Zambo has waited so\r\nlong, with all our difficulties and dangers left like a dream behind us\r\nupon the summit of those vast ruddy crags which tower above our heads.\r\nWe have descended in safety, though in a most unexpected fashion, and\r\nall is well with us.  In six weeks or two months we shall be in London,\r\nand it is possible that this letter may not reach you much earlier than\r\nwe do ourselves.  Already our hearts yearn and our spirits fly towards\r\nthe great mother city which holds so much that is dear to us.",
    "It was on the very evening of our perilous adventure with Challenger's\r\n#NN# balloon that the change came in our fortunes.  I have said\r\nthat the one person from whom we had had some sign of sympathy in our\r\nattempts to get away was the young chief whom we had rescued.  He alone\r\nhad no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land.  He had\r\ntold us as much by his expressive language of signs.  That evening,\r\nafter dusk, he came down to our little camp, handed me (for some reason\r\nhe had always shown his attentions to me, perhaps because I was the one\r\nwho was nearest his age) a small roll of the bark of a tree, and then\r\npointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him, he had put his\r\nfinger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to\r\nhis people.",
    "I took the slip of bark to the #NN# and we examined it together.\r\nIt was about a foot square, and on the inner side there was a singular\r\narrangement of lines, which I here reproduce:",
    "They were neatly done in #JJ# upon the white surface, and looked to\r\nme at first sight like some sort of rough #JJ# score.",
    "\"Whatever it is, I can swear that it is of importance to us,\" said I.\r\n\"I could read that on his face as he gave it.\"",
    "\"#IN# we have come upon a primitive practical #NN#,\" Summerlee\r\nsuggested, \"which I should think would be one of the most elementary\r\ndevelopments of man.\"",
    "\"It is clearly some sort of #NN#,\" said Challenger.",
    "\"#VBZ# like a guinea puzzle #NN#,\" remarked Lord John, #VBG#\r\nhis neck to have a look at it.  Then suddenly he stretched out his hand\r\nand seized the puzzle.",
    "\"By George!\" he cried, \"I believe I've got it.  The boy guessed right\r\nthe very first time.  See here!  How many marks are on that paper?\r\n#NN#.  Well, if you come to think of it there are #NN# cave\r\nopenings on the #NN# above us.\"",
    "\"He pointed up to the caves when he gave it to me,\" said I.",
    "\"Well, that #VBZ# it.  This is a chart of the caves.  What!  Eighteen\r\nof them all in a row, some short, some deep, some branching, same as we\r\nsaw them.  It's a map, and here's a cross on it. What's the cross for?\r\nIt is placed to mark one that is much deeper than the others.\"",
    "\"One that goes through,\" I cried.",
    "\"I believe our young friend has read the riddle,\" said Challenger.  \"If\r\nthe cave does not go through I do not understand why this person, who\r\nhas every reason to mean us well, should have drawn our attention to\r\nit.  But if it does go through and comes out at the corresponding point\r\non the other side, we should not have more than a hundred feet to\r\ndescend.\"",
    "\"A hundred feet!\" #VBD# Summerlee.",
    "\"Well, our rope is still more than a hundred feet long,\" I cried.\r\n\"Surely we could get down.\"",
    "\"How about the Indians in the cave?\" Summerlee #VBD#.",
    "\"There are no Indians in any of the caves above our heads,\" said I.\r\n\"They are all used as #NNS# and #NN#.  Why should we not go up\r\nnow at once and spy out the land?\"",
    "There is a dry #JJ# wood upon the plateau--a species of\r\n#NN#, according to our #NN# is always used by the\r\nIndians for #NNS#.  Each of us picked up a #NN# of this, and we\r\nmade our way up #NN# steps to the particular cave which was\r\nmarked in the drawing.  It was, as I had said, empty, save for a great\r\nnumber of enormous #NNS#, which flapped round our heads as we advanced\r\ninto it.  As we had no desire to draw the attention of the Indians to\r\nour proceedings, we stumbled along in the dark until we had gone round\r\nseveral curves and penetrated a considerable distance into the #NN#.\r\nThen, at last, we lit our torches.  It was a beautiful dry tunnel with\r\nsmooth gray walls covered with native symbols, a curved roof which\r\narched over our heads, and white glistening sand beneath our feet.  We\r\nhurried eagerly along it until, with a deep groan of bitter\r\ndisappointment, we were brought to a halt.  A sheer wall of rock had\r\nappeared before us, with no chink through which a mouse could have\r\nslipped.  There was no escape for us there.",
    "We stood with bitter hearts staring at this unexpected obstacle.  It\r\nwas not the result of any convulsion, as in the case of the ascending\r\ntunnel.  The end wall was exactly like the side ones.  It was, and had\r\nalways been, a #NN#.",
    "\"Never mind, my friends,\" said the #JJ# Challenger.  \"You have\r\nstill my firm promise of a balloon.\"",
    "Summerlee groaned.",
    "\"Can we be in the wrong cave?\" I suggested.",
    "\"No use, young fellah,\" said Lord John, with his finger on the chart.\r\n\"#NN# from the right and second from the left.  This is the cave\r\nsure enough.\"",
    "I looked at the mark to which his finger pointed, and I gave a sudden\r\ncry of joy.",
    "\"I believe I have it!  #VB# me!  Follow me!\"",
    "I hurried back along the way we had come, my torch in my hand.  \"Here,\"\r\nsaid I, pointing to some matches upon the ground, \"is where we lit up.\"",
    "\"Exactly.\"",
    "\"Well, it is marked as a #JJ# cave, and in the darkness we passed the\r\nfork before the torches were lit.  On the right side as we go out we\r\nshould find the longer arm.\"",
    "It was as I had said.  We had not gone thirty yards before a great\r\nblack opening loomed in the wall.  We turned into it to find that we\r\nwere in a much larger passage than before.  Along it we hurried in\r\nbreathless impatience for many hundreds of yards.  Then, suddenly, in\r\nthe black darkness of the #NN# in front of us we saw a gleam of dark\r\nred light.  We stared in amazement.  A sheet of #JJ# flame seemed to\r\ncross the passage and to bar our way.  We hastened towards it.  No\r\nsound, no heat, no movement came from it, but still the great #JJ#\r\ncurtain glowed before us, #VBG# all the cave and turning the sand\r\nto #JJ# jewels, until as we drew closer it discovered a #JJ#\r\nedge.",
    "\"The moon, by George!\" cried Lord John.  \"We are through, boys!  We are\r\nthrough!\"",
    "It was indeed the full moon which shone straight down the #NN#\r\nwhich opened upon the cliffs.  It was a small rift, not larger than a\r\nwindow, but it was enough for all our purposes.  As we #VBN# our necks\r\nthrough it we could see that the descent was not a very difficult one,\r\nand that the level ground was no very great way below us.  It was no\r\nwonder that from below we had not observed the place, as the cliffs\r\ncurved overhead and an ascent at the spot would have seemed so\r\nimpossible as to #VB# close #NN#.  We satisfied ourselves\r\nthat with the help of our rope we could find our way down, and then\r\nreturned, #VBG#, to our camp to make our preparations for the next\r\nevening.",
    "What we did we had to do quickly and secretly, since even at this last\r\nhour the Indians might hold us back.  Our stores we would leave behind\r\nus, save only our guns and cartridges.  But Challenger had some\r\nunwieldy stuff which he #RB# desired to take with him, and one\r\nparticular package, of which I may not speak, which gave us more labor\r\nthan any.  Slowly the day passed, but when the darkness fell we were\r\nready for our departure.  With much labor we got our things up the\r\nsteps, and then, looking back, took one last long #NN# of that\r\nstrange land, soon I fear to be #VBN#, the prey of hunter and\r\n#NN#, but to each of us a dreamland of glamour and romance, a\r\nland where we had dared much, suffered much, and learned #NN#\r\nland, as we shall ever #RB# call it.  Along upon our left the\r\n#VBG# caves each #NN# out its ruddy cheery firelight into the\r\ngloom.  From the slope below us rose the voices of the Indians as they\r\nlaughed and #VBD#.  Beyond was the long sweep of the woods, and in the\r\ncenter, shimmering vaguely through the gloom, was the great lake, the\r\nmother of strange monsters.  Even as we looked a high #VBG# cry,\r\nthe call of some weird animal, rang clear out of the darkness.  It was\r\nthe very voice of Maple White Land bidding us good-bye.  We turned and\r\nplunged into the cave which led to home.",
    "Two hours later, we, our packages, and all we owned, were at the foot\r\nof the cliff.  Save for Challenger's luggage we had never a difficulty.\r\nLeaving it all where we descended, we started at once for Zambo's camp.\r\nIn the early morning we approached it, but only to find, to our\r\namazement, not one fire but a dozen upon the plain.  The rescue party\r\nhad arrived.  There were twenty Indians from the river, with #NNS#,\r\nropes, and all that could be useful for bridging the chasm.  At least\r\nwe shall have no difficulty now in carrying our packages, when\r\nto-morrow we begin to make our way back to the Amazon.",
    "And so, in humble and thankful mood, I close this account.  Our eyes\r\nhave seen great wonders and our souls are chastened by what we have\r\nendured.  Each is in his own way a better and deeper man.  It may be\r\nthat when we reach Para we shall stop to #NN#.  If we do, this letter\r\nwill be a mail ahead.  If not, it will reach London on the very day\r\nthat I do.  In either case, my dear Mr. McArdle, I hope very soon to\r\nshake you by the hand.",
    "                           CHAPTER XVI",
    "                  \"A #NN#!  A Procession!\"",
    "I should wish to place upon record here our gratitude to all our\r\nfriends upon the Amazon for the very great kindness and #NN#\r\nwhich was shown to us upon our return journey.  Very particularly would\r\nI thank #NN# #NN# and other #NNS# of the Brazilian Government\r\nfor the special arrangements by which we were helped upon our way, and\r\nSenhor Pereira of Para, to whose #NN# we owe the complete outfit\r\nfor a decent appearance in the #JJ# world which we found ready for\r\nus at that town.  It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we\r\nencountered that we should deceive our hosts and #NNS#, but under\r\nthe circumstances we had really no alternative, and I #RB# tell them\r\nthat they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to\r\nfollow upon our traces.  Even the names have been altered in our\r\naccounts, and I am very sure that no one, from the most careful study\r\nof them, could come within a thousand miles of our unknown land.",
    "The excitement which had been caused through those parts of South\r\nAmerica which we had to traverse was imagined by us to be purely local,\r\nand I can assure our friends in England that we had no notion of the\r\nuproar which the mere #NN# of our experiences had caused through\r\nEurope.  It was not until the #NN# was within five hundred miles of\r\nSouthampton that the #JJ# messages from paper after paper and\r\nagency after agency, offering huge #NNS# for a short return message as\r\nto our actual results, showed us how strained was the attention not\r\nonly of the scientific world but of the general public.  It was agreed\r\namong us, however, that no definite statement should be given to the\r\nPress until we had met the members of the Zoological Institute, since\r\nas #NNS# it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body\r\nfrom which we had received our commission of investigation.  Thus,\r\nalthough we found Southampton full of Pressmen, we absolutely refused\r\nto give any information, which had the natural effect of #VBG#\r\npublic attention upon the meeting which was advertised for the evening\r\nof November 7th.  For this gathering, the Zoological Hall which had\r\nbeen the scene of the #NN# of our task was found to be far too\r\nsmall, and it was only in the Queen's Hall in Regent Street that\r\n#NN# could be found.  It is now common knowledge the #NNS#\r\nmight have ventured upon the Albert Hall and still found their space\r\ntoo scanty.",
    "It was for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting\r\nhad been fixed.  For the first, we had each, no doubt, our own pressing\r\npersonal affairs to #VB# us.  Of mine I cannot yet speak.  It may be\r\nthat as it stands further from me I may think of it, and even speak of\r\nit, with less emotion.  I have shown the reader in the beginning of\r\nthis narrative where lay the springs of my action.  It is but right,\r\nperhaps, that I should carry on the tale and show also the results.\r\nAnd yet the day may come when I would not have it otherwise.  At least\r\nI have been driven forth to take part in a wondrous adventure, and I\r\ncannot but be thankful to the force that drove me.",
    "And now I turn to the last supreme #JJ# moment of our adventure.\r\nAs I was #VBG# my brain as to how I should best describe it, my eyes\r\nfell upon the issue of my own Journal for the morning of the 8th of\r\nNovember with the full and excellent account of my friend and\r\n#NN# #NN#.  What can I do better than #VB# his\r\n#NNS# and all?

The general public, however, which most #RB#\r\n#VBN# a grievance at having been #VBN#, stormed the doors at a\r\nquarter to eight, after a prolonged #NN# in which several people were\r\ninjured, including Inspector #NN# of H. #NNP#, whose leg was\r\nunfortunately broken.  After this #JJ# invasion, which not\r\nonly filled every passage, but even intruded upon the space set apart\r\nfor the Press, it is #VBN# that nearly five thousand people awaited\r\nthe arrival of the travelers.  When they eventually appeared, they took\r\ntheir places in the front of a platform which already contained all the\r\nleading scientific men, not only of this country, but of France and of\r\nGermany.  #NNP# was also represented, in the person of Professor\r\n#NNS#, the famous #NN# of the University of #NNP#.  The\r\nentrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a\r\nremarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and\r\ncheering for some minutes.  An acute observer might, however, have\r\ndetected some signs of #NN# amid the applause, and gathered that the\r\nproceedings were likely to become more #RB# than #JJ#.  It may\r\nsafely be #VBD#, however, that no one could have foreseen the\r\nextraordinary turn which they were actually to take.",
    "\"Of the appearance of the four #NNS# little need be said, since\r\ntheir photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers.\r\nThey bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have\r\nundergone.

    "\"When quiet had been #VBN# and the audience resumed their seats\r\nafter the #NN# which they had given to the travelers, the chairman,\r\nthe Duke of #NNP#, addressed the meeting.  'He would not,' he said,\r\n'stand for more than a moment between that vast assembly and the #NN#\r\nwhich lay before them.  It was not for him to anticipate what Professor\r\nSummerlee, who was the #NN# of the committee, had to say to them,\r\nbut it was common rumor that their expedition had been crowned by\r\nextraordinary success.'

Having described, in\r\ngeneral terms, their course from the main river up to the time that\r\nthey actually reached the base of the cliffs, he enthralled his #NNS#\r\nby his account of the difficulties encountered by the expedition in\r\ntheir repeated attempts to mount them, and finally described how they\r\nsucceeded in their desperate #NNS#, which cost the lives of their\r\ntwo devoted half-breed servants.\" (This amazing reading of the affair\r\nwas the result of Summerlee's endeavors to avoid raising any\r\nquestionable matter at the meeting.)",
    "\"Having conducted his audience in fancy to the summit, and marooned\r\nthem there by reason of the fall of their bridge, the Professor\r\nproceeded to describe both the horrors and the attractions of that\r\nremarkable land.  Of personal adventures he said little, but laid\r\nstress upon the rich harvest #VBN# by Science in the observations of\r\nthe wonderful beast, bird, insect, and plant life of the plateau.\r\n#RB# rich in the #NN# and in the #NN#, #NN# new\r\nspecies of the one and #NN# of the other had been secured in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks.  It was, however, in the larger animals, and\r\nespecially in the larger animals supposed to have been long extinct,\r\nthat the interest of the public was naturally centered.  Of these he\r\nwas able to give a goodly list, but had little doubt that it would be\r\nlargely extended when the place had been more thoroughly investigated.\r\nHe and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures, most of them\r\nat a distance, which corresponded with nothing at present known to\r\nScience.  These would in time be duly #VBN# and examined.  He\r\n#VBN# a snake, the cast skin of which, deep purple in color, was\r\n#NN# feet in length, and mentioned a white creature, supposed to\r\nbe #JJ#, which gave forth well-marked #NN# in the\r\ndarkness; also a large black #NN#, the bite of which was supposed by\r\nthe Indians to be highly poisonous.  #VBG# aside these entirely new\r\nforms of life, the plateau was very rich in known prehistoric forms,\r\n#VBG# back in some cases to early Jurassic times.  Among these he\r\nmentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus, seen once by Mr.\r\nMalone at a drinking-place by the lake, and drawn in the sketch-book of\r\nthat adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world.\r\nHe described also the iguanodon and the #NN# of the first\r\nof the wonders which they had encountered.  He then #VBN# the\r\nassembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaurs, which\r\nhad on more than one occasion pursued members of the party, and which\r\nwere the most formidable of all the creatures which they had\r\nencountered.  #RB# he passed to the huge and ferocious bird, the\r\n#NNS#, and to the great elk which still #VBZ# upon this #JJ#.\r\nIt was not, however, until he sketched the mysteries of the central\r\nlake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were\r\naroused.  One had to pinch oneself to be sure that one was #JJ# as one\r\nheard this sane and practical Professor in cold measured tones\r\ndescribing the monstrous #VBN# #NN# and the huge\r\n#NN# which inhabit this #VBN# sheet of water.  Next he\r\ntouched upon the Indians, and upon the extraordinary colony of\r\nanthropoid apes, which might be looked upon as an advance upon the\r\npithecanthropus of Java, and as coming therefore nearer than any known\r\nform to that #JJ# creation, the missing link.  Finally he\r\ndescribed, amongst some merriment, the ingenious but highly dangerous\r\n#NN# invention of Professor Challenger, and wound up a most\r\nmemorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee\r\ndid at last find their way back to civilization.",

It was clear, from\r\nthe moment of his rising, that he had a number of friends and\r\n#NNS# in the hall, though they formed a #NN# in the\r\naudience.

He much #VBD# that any personal #NNS# should have been\r\nread into his remarks, which were entirely #VBN# by his desire for\r\nscientific truth.  His position, in fact, was #RB# the same as\r\nthat taken up by Professor Summerlee at the last meeting.  At that last\r\nmeeting Professor Challenger had made certain assertions which had been\r\n#VBN# by his colleague.

There had been\r\nrecent #NNS# of travelers #VBG# from the unknown with certain\r\n#NNS# which had been too readily accepted.  Was the London Zoological\r\nInstitute to place itself in this position?  He admitted that the\r\nmembers of the committee were men of character.  But human nature was\r\nvery complex.

The corroboration of these wondrous tales was really of\r\nthe most slender description.  What did it amount to?

I move, then, that, while Professor Summerlee be thanked for\r\nhis interesting address, the whole matter shall be regarded as\r\n'#NN#,' and shall be referred back to a larger, and possibly more\r\n#JJ# Committee of Investigation.'",
    "\"It is difficult to describe the confusion caused by this amendment.

Suddenly,\r\nhowever, there was a pause, a hush, and then complete silence.\r\nProfessor Challenger was on his feet.

We had hoped that we should find upon\r\nour return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint\r\nconclusions.  #VBD#, however, by my previous experience, I have not\r\ncome without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man.

Professor\r\nChallenger drew off the top of the case, which formed a sliding lid.\r\n#VBG# down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was\r\nheard from the Press seat to say, 'Come, then, pretty, pretty!' in a\r\ncoaxing voice.  An instant later, with a scratching, #VBG# sound, a\r\nmost horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched\r\nitself upon the side of the case.

The face of the\r\ncreature was like the wildest #NN# that the imagination of a mad\r\nmedieval #NN# could have conceived.  It was malicious, horrible,\r\nwith two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal.  Its long,\r\nsavage mouth, which was held half-open, was full of a double row of\r\n#NN# teeth.  Its shoulders were #VBN#, and round them were\r\ndraped what appeared to be a faded gray #NN#.  It was the devil of our\r\nchildhood in person.  There was a turmoil in the #NN#\r\nscreamed, two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs,\r\nand there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their\r\nchairman into the orchestra.  For a moment there was danger of a\r\ngeneral panic.  Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the\r\n#NN#, but the movement alarmed the creature beside him.  Its\r\nstrange shawl suddenly #VBN#, spread, and fluttered as a pair of\r\nleathery wings.  Its owner #VBD# at its legs, but too late to hold\r\nit.  It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the\r\nQueen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while\r\na putrid and #JJ# odor pervaded the room.  The cries of the people\r\nin the #NNS#, who were alarmed at the near approach of those\r\nglowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a #NN#.\r\n#JJR# and faster it flew, beating against walls and #NNS# in a\r\nblind frenzy of alarm.  'The window!  For heaven's sake shut that\r\nwindow!' roared the Professor from the platform, dancing and #VBG#\r\nhis hands in an agony of apprehension.  Alas, his warning was too late!\r\nIn a moment the creature, beating and #VBG# along the wall like a\r\nhuge moth within a #NN#, came upon the opening, squeezed its\r\nhideous bulk through it, and was gone.  Professor Challenger fell back\r\ninto his chair with his face buried in his hands, while the audience\r\ngave one long, deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident\r\nwas over.",
    "\"#NN#! how shall one describe what took place #NN# the full\r\n#NN# of the #NN# and the full #NN# of the minority united\r\nto make one great wave of enthusiasm, which rolled from the back of the\r\nhall, gathering volume as it came, swept over the orchestra, #VBN#\r\nthe platform, and carried the four heroes away upon its #NN#?\"  (Good\r\nfor you, Mac!)  \"If the audience had done less than justice, surely it\r\nmade ample #NNS#.  Every one was on his feet.  Every one was moving,\r\nshouting, #VBG#.  A dense crowd of cheering men were round the\r\nfour travelers.

There was a swirl in the packed #NN#, and a slow\r\ncurrent, bearing the four upon their shoulders, made for the door.  Out\r\nin the street the scene was extraordinary.  An assemblage of not less\r\nthan a hundred thousand people was waiting.  The #VBN# #NN#\r\nextended from the other side of the #NN# Hotel to #NNP# #NNP#.

If I have not said much about it before, it was,\r\nof course, that the Professor's earnest desire was that no possible\r\nrumor of the #JJ# argument which we carried should be allowed\r\nto #NN# out until the moment came when his enemies were to be confuted.",
    "One word as to the fate of the London pterodactyl.  Nothing can be said\r\nto be certain upon this point.  There is the evidence of two frightened\r\nwomen that it perched upon the roof of the Queen's Hall and remained\r\nthere like a diabolical statue for some hours.  The next day it came\r\nout in the evening papers that Private #NNP#, of the #NN# #NNPS#,\r\non duty outside #NNP# House, had deserted his post without leave,\r\nand was therefore #VBN#.  Private Miles' account, that he\r\ndropped his rifle and took to his heels down the Mall because on\r\nlooking up he had suddenly seen the devil between him and the moon, was\r\nnot accepted by the Court, and yet it may have a direct bearing upon\r\nthe point at issue.

    "Let me tell it in a few words.  No letter or telegram had come to me at\r\nSouthampton, and I reached the little villa at #NN# about ten\r\no'clock that night in a fever of alarm.

She was seated in a low #NN# under the shaded\r\nstandard lamp by the piano.  In three steps I was across the room and\r\nhad both her hands in mine.",
    "\"Gladys!\" I cried, \"Gladys!\"",
    "She looked up with amazement in her face.  She was altered in some\r\nsubtle way.  The expression of her eyes, the hard upward stare, the set\r\nof the lips, was new to me.  She drew back her hands.",
    "\"What do you mean?\" she said.",
    "\"Gladys!\" I cried.  \"What is the matter?  You are my Gladys, are you\r\n#NN# Gladys Hungerton?\"",
    "\"No,\" said she, \"I am Gladys #NNP#.  Let me introduce you to my\r\nhusband.\"",
    "How absurd life is!  I found myself #RB# bowing and shaking\r\nhands with a little #VBN# man who was coiled up in the deep\r\narm-chair which had once been sacred to my own use.  We #VBD# and\r\ngrinned in front of each other.",
    "\"#NNP# #VBZ# us stay here.  We are getting our house ready,\" said\r\nGladys.",
    "\"Oh, yes,\" said I.",
    "\"You didn't get my letter at Para, then?\"",
    "\"No, I got no letter.\"",
    "\"Oh, what a pity!  It would have made all clear.\"",
    "\"It is quite clear,\" said I.",
    "\"I've told #NNP# all about you,\" said she.  \"We have no secrets.  I\r\nam so sorry about it.  But it couldn't have been so very deep, could\r\nit, if you could go off to the other end of the world and leave me here\r\nalone.  You're not #JJ#, are you?\"",
    "\"No, no, not at all.  I think I'll go.\"",
    "\"Have some refreshment,\" said the little man, and he added, in a\r\nconfidential way, \"It's always like this, ain't it?  And must be unless\r\nyou had #NN#, only the other way round; you understand.\" He laughed\r\nlike an #JJ#, while I made for the door.",

    "\"Well, within reason,\" said he.",
    "\"How did you do it?  Have you searched for hidden treasure, or\r\ndiscovered a #NN#, or done time on a #NN#, or flown the Channel, or\r\nwhat?  Where is the glamour of romance?  How did you get it?\"",

    "\"Good-night!\" said I, and vanished, like all disconsolate and\r\n#VBN# heroes, into the darkness, with grief and rage and\r\nlaughter all #VBG# within me like a boiling pot.",
    "One more little scene, and I have done.  Last night we all supped at\r\nLord John Roxton's rooms, and sitting together afterwards we smoked in\r\ngood comradeship and talked our adventures over.  It was strange under\r\nthese altered surroundings to see the old, well-known faces and\r\nfigures.  There was Challenger, with his smile of condescension, his\r\ndrooping eyelids, his intolerant eyes, his aggressive beard, his huge\r\nchest, #VBG# and puffing as he laid down the law to Summerlee.  And\r\nSummerlee, too, there he was with his short briar between his thin\r\nmoustache and his gray goat'#NN#, his worn face protruded in eager\r\ndebate as he queried all Challenger's #NNS#.  Finally, there was\r\nour host, with his #JJ#, eagle face, and his cold, blue, glacier eyes\r\nwith always a #NN# of #NN# and of humor down in the depths of\r\nthem.  Such is the last picture of them that I have carried away.",
    "It was after supper, in his own #NN# room of the pink radiance\r\nand the innumerable #NN# Lord John Roxton had something to\r\nsay to us.  From a cupboard he had brought an old cigar-box, and this\r\nhe laid before him on the table.",
    "\"There's one thing,\" said he, \"that maybe I should have spoken about\r\nbefore this, but I wanted to know a little more clearly where I was.\r\nNo use to raise hopes and let them down again.  But it's facts, not\r\nhopes, with us now.  You may remember that day we found the pterodactyl\r\nrookery in the #NN#?  Well, somethin' in the #NN# of the land\r\ntook my notice.  Perhaps it has escaped you, so I will tell you.  It\r\nwas a volcanic #NN# full of blue clay.\" The Professors nodded.",
    "\"Well, now, in the whole world I've only had to do with one place that\r\nwas a volcanic vent of blue clay.  That was the great #NNP# #NNP# #NNP#\r\n#NNP# of #NN#?  So you see I got #NNS# into my head.  I\r\nrigged up a contraption to hold off those #VBG# beasts, and I spent\r\na happy day there with a spud.  This is what I got.\"",
    "He opened his cigar-box, and #VBG# it over he poured about twenty or\r\nthirty rough stones, varying from the size of #NNS# to that of\r\nchestnuts, on the table.",
    "\"Perhaps you think I should have told you then.  Well, so I should,\r\nonly I know there are a lot of traps for the #JJ#, and that stones\r\nmay be of any size and yet of little value where color and #NN#\r\nare clean off.  Therefore, I brought them back, and on the first day at\r\nhome I took one round to #NN#'s, and asked him to have it roughly cut\r\nand #VBN#.\"",
    "He took a pill-box from his pocket, and #VBD# out of it a beautiful\r\n#VBG# #NN#, one of the #JJS# stones that I have ever seen.",
    "\"There's the result,\" said he.  \"He prices the lot at a minimum of two\r\nhundred thousand pounds.  Of course it is fair #NNS# between us.  I\r\nwon't hear of anythin' else.  Well, Challenger, what will you do with\r\nyour fifty thousand?\"",
    "\"If you really #VB# in your #JJ# view,\" said the Professor, \"I\r\nshould found a private museum, which has long been one of my dreams.\"",
    "\"I would #VB# from #VBG#, and so find time for my final\r\nclassification of the chalk #NNS#.\"",

    "\"Man, he's a #NN# living wonder!\" said McArdle, shaking his head\r\n#RB#.  \"He'd put up the feathers of a #NN# and set up a\r\nriot in a #NNS#' meeting.  No wonder he has made London too hot for\r\nhim.  It's a #NN#, Mr. Malone, for it's a grand brain!  We'll let's have\r\nthe analogy.\"",
    "\"We will suppose,\" I read, \"that a small bundle of connected #NNS# was\r\n#VBN# in a sluggish current upon a voyage across the Atlantic.  The\r\ncorks drift slowly on from day to day with the same conditions all round\r\nthem.  If the corks were #JJ# we could imagine that they would\r\nconsider these conditions to be permanent and assured.  But we, with our\r\nsuperior knowledge, know that many things might happen to surprise the\r\ncorks.  They might possibly #VB# up against a ship, or a sleeping #NN#,\r\nor become entangled in #VBN#.  In any case, their voyage would probably\r\nend by their being thrown up on the rocky coast of #NNP#.

    "\"The general blurring and #VBG# of Fraunhofer's lines of the #NN#\r\npoint, in my opinion, to a widespread cosmic change of a subtle and\r\nsingular character.  #NNP# from a planet is the reflected light of the\r\nsun.  Light from a star is a #VBN# light.  But the spectra both\r\nfrom planets and stars have, in this instance, all undergone the same\r\nchange.  Is it, then, a change in those planets and stars?  To me such an\r\nidea is inconceivable.  What common change could simultaneously come upon\r\nthem all?  Is it a change in our own atmosphere?  It is possible, but in\r\nthe highest degree improbable, since we see no signs of it around us, and\r\nchemical #NN# has failed to #VB# it.  What, then, is the third\r\npossibility?  That it may be a change in the conducting medium, in that\r\ninfinitely fine ether which extends from star to star and #VBZ# the\r\nwhole universe.  #NNP# in that ocean we are floating upon a slow current.\r\nMight that current not drift us into #NNS# of ether which are novel and\r\nhave properties of which we have never conceived?  There is a change\r\nsomewhere.  This cosmic disturbance of the spectrum proves it.  It may be\r\na good change.  It may be an evil one.  It may be a #JJ# one.  We do\r\nnot know.  #JJ# #NNS# may treat the matter as one which can be\r\ndisregarded, but one who like myself is possessed of the deeper\r\nintelligence of the true #NN# will understand that the\r\npossibilities of the universe are incalculable and that the wisest man is\r\nhe who holds himself ready for the unexpected.  To take an obvious\r\nexample, who would undertake to say that the mysterious and universal\r\noutbreak of illness, recorded in your columns this very morning as having\r\nbroken out among the #JJ# races of Sumatra, has no connection with\r\nsome cosmic change to which they may #VB# more quickly than the more\r\ncomplex #NNS# of Europe?  I throw out the idea for what it is worth.\r\nTo #VB# it is, in the present stage, as #JJ# as to deny it, but\r\nit is an #JJ# #NN# who is too dense to perceive that it is\r\nwell within the bounds of scientific possibility.",

    "I had to confess my total and #JJ# ignorance of the subject at\r\nissue.  What, for example, were Fraunhofer's lines?  McArdle had just\r\nbeen studying the matter with the aid of our tame scientist at the\r\noffice, and he picked from his desk two of those #VBN# #JJ#\r\n#NNS# which bear a general resemblance to the #NNS# of some young\r\nand ambitious #NN# club.  He pointed out to me that there were certain\r\nblack lines which formed #NNS# upon the series of brilliant colours\r\nextending from the red at one end through #NNS# of orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, and #NN# to the violet at the other.",
    "\"Those dark bands are Fraunhofer's lines,\" said he.  \"The colours are\r\njust light itself.  Every light, if you can split it up with a #NN#,\r\ngives the same colours.

    "\"Well said, young #NN#,\" said Lord John Roxton.  Then, with a\r\nkindly smile, he slapped Professor Summerlee upon his shoulder.  \"Come,\r\nHerr Professor, we're not going to quarrel at this time of day.  We've\r\nseen too much together.  But keep off the grass when you get near\r\nChallenger, for this young fellah and I have a bit of a weakness for the\r\nold dear.\"",
    "But Summerlee was in no humour for #NN#.  His face was screwed up\r\nin rigid disapproval, and thick curls of angry smoke rolled up from his\r\npipe.",
    "\"As to you, Lord John Roxton,\" he creaked, \"your opinion upon a matter of\r\nscience is of as much value in my eyes as my views upon a new type of\r\nshot-gun would be in yours.  I have my own judgment, sir, and I use it in\r\nmy own way.  Because it has misled me once, is that any reason why I\r\nshould accept without criticism anything, however #JJ#, which this\r\nman may care to put forward?  Are we to have a #NNP# of science, with\r\n#JJ# #NNS# laid down #NN# #NN#, and accepted without question\r\nby the poor humble public?  I tell you, sir, that I have a brain of my\r\nown and that I should feel myself to be a #NN# and a slave if I did not\r\nuse it.  If it #VBZ# you to believe this #NN# about ether and\r\nFraunhofer's lines upon the spectrum, do so by all means, but do not ask\r\none who is #JJR# and wiser than yourself to share in your folly.  Is it\r\nnot evident that if the ether were affected to the degree which he\r\n#VBZ#, and if it were #JJ# to human health, the result of it\r\nwould already be apparent upon our#NNS#?\" Here he laughed with\r\nuproarious triumph over his own argument.  \"Yes, sir, we should already\r\nbe very far from our normal selves, and instead of sitting quietly\r\ndiscussing scientific problems in a railway train we should be showing\r\nactual symptoms of the poison which was working within us.  Where do we\r\nsee any signs of this poisonous cosmic disturbance?  #NN# me that, sir!\r\nAnswer me that!  Come, come, no evasion!  I pin you to an answer!\"",
    "I felt more and more angry.  There was something very #JJ# and\r\naggressive in Summerlee's demeanour.",
    "\"I think that if you knew more about the facts you might be less positive\r\nin your opinion,\" said I.",
    "Summerlee took his pipe from his mouth and fixed me with a stony stare.",
    "\"Pray what do you mean, sir, by that somewhat #JJ# observation?\"",
    "\"I mean that when I was leaving the office the news editor told me that a\r\ntelegram had come in #VBG# the general illness of the Sumatra\r\nnatives, and adding that the lights had not been lit in the Straits of\r\n#NNP#.\"",
    "\"Really, there should be some limits to human folly!\" cried Summerlee in\r\na positive fury.  \"Is it possible that you do not realize that ether, if\r\nfor a moment we adopt Challenger's preposterous supposition, is a\r\nuniversal substance which is the same here as at the other side of the\r\nworld?  Do you for an instant suppose that there is an English ether and\r\na #NN# ether?  Perhaps you imagine that the ether of Kent is in some\r\nway superior to the ether of Surrey, through which this train is now\r\nbearing us.  There really are no bounds to the credulity and ignorance of\r\nthe average layman.  Is it conceivable that the ether in Sumatra should\r\nbe so deadly as to cause total #NN# at the very time when the\r\nether here has had no appreciable effect upon us whatever?  Personally, I\r\ncan truly say that I never felt stronger in body or better balanced in\r\nmind in my life.\"",
    "\"That may be.  I don't profess to be a scientific man,\" said I, \"though I\r\nhave heard somewhere that the science of one generation is usually the\r\nfallacy of the next.  But it does not take much common sense to see that,\r\nas we seem to know so little about ether, it might be affected by some\r\nlocal conditions in various parts of the world and might show an effect\r\nover there which would only develop later with us.\"",
    "\"With 'might' and 'may' you can prove anything,\" cried Summerlee\r\nfuriously.  \"#NNPS# may fly.  Yes, sir, #NNS# #NN# #NN# they don't.  It\r\nis not worth arguing with you.  Challenger has filled you with his\r\nnonsense and you are both #JJ# of reason.  I had as soon lay\r\narguments before those railway cushions.\"",
    "\"I must say, Professor Summerlee, that your manners do not seem to have\r\nimproved since I last had the pleasure of meeting you,\" said Lord John\r\nseverely.",
    "\"You #NNS# are not accustomed to hear the truth,\" Summerlee answered\r\nwith a bitter smile.  \"It comes as a bit of a shock, does it not, when\r\nsomeone makes you realize that your title leaves you none the less a very\r\nignorant man?\"",
    "\"Upon my word, sir,\" said Lord John, very stern and rigid, \"if you were a\r\nyounger man you would not dare to speak to me in so offensive a fashion.\"",
    "Summerlee thrust out his chin, with its little wagging tuft of goatee\r\nbeard.",
    "\"I would have you know, sir, that, young or old, there has never been a\r\ntime in my life when I was afraid to speak my mind to an ignorant\r\n#NNS#, sir, an ignorant #NN#, if you had as many titles as\r\nslaves could invent and fools could adopt.\"",
    "For a moment Lord John's eyes blazed, and then, with a tremendous effort,\r\nhe mastered his anger and leaned back in his seat with arms folded and a\r\nbitter smile upon his face.  To me all this was dreadful and deplorable.\r\nLike a wave, the memory of the past swept over me, the good comradeship,\r\nthe happy, adventurous #NN# that we had suffered and worked for and\r\nwon.  That it should have come to #NN# insults and abuse!  Suddenly I\r\nwas #NN# in loud, #VBG#, #JJ# #NNS# which refused\r\nto be concealed.  My companions looked at me in surprise.  I covered my\r\nface with my hands.",
    "\"It's all right,\" said I.  \"#NN# it #NN# such a pity!\"",
    "\"You're ill, young fellah, that's what's amiss with you,\" said Lord John.\r\n\"I thought you were queer from the first.\"",
    "\"Your habits, sir, have not #VBN# in these three years,\" said Summerlee,\r\nshaking his head.  \"I also did not fail to observe your strange manner\r\nthe moment we met.  You need not waste your sympathy, Lord John.  These\r\n#NNS# are purely #JJ#.  The man has been drinking.  By the way, Lord\r\nJohn, I called you a coxcomb just now, which was perhaps unduly severe.\r\nBut the word #VBZ# me of a small #NN#, trivial but #JJ#,\r\nwhich I used to possess.  You know me as the austere man of science.  Can\r\nyou believe that I once had a #JJ# reputation in several\r\n#NNS# as a #NN# #NN#?  Perhaps I can help you to pass the\r\ntime in a pleasant way.  Would it #VB# you to hear me #NN# like a cock?\"",
    "\"No, sir,\" said Lord John, who was still greatly offended, \"it would\r\n#VB# amuse me.\"",
    "\"My #NN# of the #VBG# #NN# who had just laid an egg was also\r\nconsidered rather above the average.  Might I venture?\"",
    "\"No, sir, #RB# not.\"",
    "But in spite of this earnest #NN#, Professor Summerlee laid down\r\nhis pipe and for the rest of our journey he #NN# failed to\r\n#NNS# by a succession of bird and animal cries which seemed so\r\nabsurd that my tears were suddenly changed into #JJ# laughter,\r\nwhich must have become quite hysterical as I sat opposite this grave\r\nProfessor and saw #NN# rather heard #NN# the character of the\r\nuproarious #NN# or the #NN# whose tail had been #JJ# upon.  Once\r\nLord John passed across his newspaper, upon the margin of which he had\r\nwritten in pencil, \"Poor devil!  #NNP# as a #NN#.\"  No doubt it was very\r\neccentric, and yet the #NN# struck me as extraordinarily clever\r\nand amusing.",
    "#NN# this was going on, Lord John leaned forward and told me some\r\ninterminable story about a buffalo and an Indian #NN# which seemed to me\r\nto have neither beginning nor end.  Professor Summerlee had just begun to\r\nchirrup like a canary, and Lord John to get to the climax of his story,\r\nwhen the train drew up at #NNP# #NNP#, which had been given us as the\r\nstation for Rotherfield.",
    "And there was Challenger to meet us.  His appearance was glorious.  Not\r\nall the #NNS# in creation could match the slow, #VBG#\r\ndignity with which he #VBN# his own railway station and the #JJ#\r\nsmile of #JJ# #NN# with which he regarded #NN#\r\naround him.  If he had changed in anything since the days of old, it was\r\nthat his points had become #VBN#.  The huge head and broad sweep of\r\nforehead, with its plastered lock of black hair, seemed even greater than\r\nbefore.  His black beard poured forward in a more #JJ# #NN#, and\r\nhis clear grey eyes, with their insolent and sardonic eyelids, were even\r\nmore masterful than of #PRP$#.",
    "He gave me the amused #NN# and encouraging smile which the head\r\nmaster #VBZ# upon the small boy, and, having greeted the others and\r\nhelped to collect their #NNS# and their cylinders of oxygen, he stowed us\r\nand them away in a large motor-car which was driven by the same impassive\r\nAustin, the man of few words, whom I had seen in the character of butler\r\nupon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the Professor.  Our\r\njourney led us up a winding hill through beautiful country.  I sat in\r\nfront with the chauffeur, but behind me my three comrades seemed to me to\r\nbe all talking together.  Lord John was still struggling with his buffalo\r\nstory, so far as I could make out, while once again I heard, as of old,\r\nthe deep #NN# of Challenger and the insistent #NNS# of Summerlee as\r\ntheir brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate.  Suddenly\r\nAustin #VBN# his #NN# face toward me without taking his eyes from\r\nhis #NN#.",
    "\"I'm under notice,\" said he.",
    "\"Dear me!\" said I.",
    "Everything seemed strange to-day.  Everyone said queer, unexpected\r\nthings.  It was like a dream.",
    "\"It's #NN# times,\" said Austin reflectively.",
    "\"When do you go?\" I asked, for want of some better observation.",
    "\"I don't go,\" said Austin.",
    "The conversation seemed to have ended there, but presently he came back\r\nto it.",
    "\"If I was to go, who would look aft#NN#r '#NN#?\"  He jerked his head toward\r\nhis master.  \"Who would 'e get to serve 'im?\"",
    "\"Someone else,\" I suggested #RB#.",
    "\"Not 'e.  No one would stay a week.  If I was to go, that '#NN# would run\r\ndown like a #NN# with the #VBG# out.  I'm telling you because\r\nyou're 'is friend, and you ought to know.  If I was to take 'im at 'is\r\n#NN# there, I wouldn't have the '#NN#.  'E and the #NN# would be\r\nlike two #NNS# left out in a bundle.  I'm just everything.  And then 'e\r\ngoes and gives me notice.\"",
    "\"Why would no one stay?\" I asked.",
    "\"Well, they wouldn't make allowances, same as I do.  'E's a very clever\r\nman, the #NN# clever that 'e's clean #JJ# sometimes.  I've seen\r\n'im right off 'is #NN#, and no error.  Well, look what 'e did this\r\nmorning.\"",
    "\"What did he do?\"",
    "Austin bent over to me.",
    "\"'E bit the '#NN#,\" said he in a hoarse whisper.",
    "\"#NN# her?\"",
    "\"Yes, sir.  Bit '#UH# on the leg.  I saw 'er with my own eyes #VBG#' a\r\n#NN# from the '#NN#.\"",
    "\"Good gracious!\"",
    "\"So you'd say, sir, if you could see some of the #NNS# on.  'E don't\r\nmake friends with the neighbors.  There's some of them thinks that when\r\n'e was up among those monsters you wrote about, it was just ''#NN#, #NNP#\r\n'Ome' for the master, and 'e was never in #NN# company.  That's what\r\n#NN# say.  But I've served 'im ten years, and I'm fond of 'im, and,\r\nmind you, 'e's a great man, when all's said an' done, and it's an honor\r\nto serve 'im.  But 'e does try one cruel at times.  Now look at that,\r\nsir.  That ain't what you might call old-fashioned '#NN#, is it\r\nnow?  Just you read it for yourself.\"",
    "The car on its lowest speed had ground its way up a steep, curving\r\nascent.  At the corner a #NN# peered over a #VBN# hedge.\r\nAs Austin said, it was not difficult to read, for the words were few and\r\narresting:--",
    "                 +---------------------------------------+\r\n                 |               #NN#.                |\r\n                 |                ----                   |\r\n                 |  #NNS#, Pressmen, and #NNS#   |\r\n                 |        are not #VBN#.            |\r\n                 |                                       |\r\n                 |                  G.

    "\"No, it's not what you might call '#NN#,\" said Austin, shaking his head\r\nand glancing up at the deplorable #NN#.  \"It wouldn't look well in a\r\n#NNP# card.  I beg your pardon, sir, for I h#NN#n't spoke as much as\r\nthis for many a long year, but to-day my feelings seem to 'ave got the\r\nbetter of me.  'E can sack me till 'e's blue in the face, but I ain't\r\ngoing, and that's flat.  I'm 'is man and 'e's my master, and so it will\r\nbe, I expect, to the end of the chapter.\"",
    "We had passed between the white posts of a gate and up a curving drive,\r\nlined with #NN# bushes.  Beyond stood a low brick house, picked\r\nout with white woodwork, very comfortable and pretty.  Mrs. Challenger, a\r\nsmall, #JJ#, smiling figure, stood in the open doorway to welcome us.",
    "\"Well, my dear,\" said Challenger, bustling out of the car, \"here are our\r\nvisitors.  It is something new for us to have visitors, is it not?  No\r\nlove lost between us and our neighbors, is there?  If they could get #NN#\r\npoison into our #NN#'s #NN#, I expect it would be there.\"",
    "\"It's #NN#!\" cried the lady, between laughter and tears.\r\n\"George is always quarreling with everyone.  We haven't a friend on the\r\n#NN#.\"",
    "\"It #VBZ# me to #VB# my attention upon my #JJ# wife,\"\r\nsaid Challenger, passing his short, thick arm round her waist.  Picture a\r\n#NN# and a #NN#, and you have the pair of them.  \"Come, come, these\r\ngentlemen are tired from the journey, and #NN# should be ready.  Has\r\nSarah returned?\"",
    "The lady shook her head #RB#, and the Professor laughed loudly and\r\nstroked his beard in his masterful fashion.",
    "\"Austin,\" he cried, \"when you have put up the car you will kindly help\r\nyour #NN# to lay the lunch.  Now, gentlemen, will you please step\r\ninto my study, for there are one or two very urgent things which I am\r\nanxious to say to you.\"",
    "Chapter II",
    "THE TIDE OF DEATH",
    "As we crossed the hall the #NN# rang, and we were the\r\n#JJ# #NNS# of Professor Challenger's end of the #VBG#\r\n#NN#.  I say \"we,\" but no one within a hundred yards could have\r\nfailed to hear the booming of that monstrous voice, which reverberated\r\nthrough the house.  His answers lingered in my mind.",
    "\"Yes, yes, of course, it is I....  Yes, certainly, #NN# Professor\r\nChallenger, the famous Professor, who else?...  Of course, every word of\r\nit, otherwise I should not have written it....  I shouldn't be\r\nsurprised....  There is every indication of it....  Within a day or so at\r\nthe #JJS#....  Well, I can't help that, can I?...  Very unpleasant, no\r\ndoubt, but I rather fancy it will affect more important people than you.\r\nThere is no use #VBG# about it....  No, I couldn't possibly.  You must\r\ntake your chance....  That's enough, sir.  #NN#!  I have something\r\nmore important to do than to listen to such #NN#.\"",
    "He shut off with a crash and led us upstairs into a large #JJ# apartment\r\nwhich formed his study.  On the great mahogany desk seven or eight\r\n#JJ# telegrams were lying.",
    "\"Really,\" he said as he gathered them up, \"I begin to think that it would\r\nsave my correspondents' money if I were to adopt a #JJ# address.\r\nPossibly '#NNP#, Rotherfield,' would be the most appropriate.\"",
    "As usual when he made an obscure joke, he leaned against the desk and\r\nbellowed in a paroxysm of laughter, his hands shaking so that he could\r\nhardly open the #NNS#.",
    "\"Noah!  Noah!\" he gasped, with a face of #NN#, while Lord John and I\r\nsmiled in sympathy and Summerlee, like a #JJ# goat, #VBD# his head\r\nin sardonic disagreement.  Finally Challenger, still rumbling and\r\n#VBG#, began to open his telegrams.  The three of us stood in the bow\r\nwindow and occupied ourselves in #VBG# the magnificent view.",
    "It was certainly worth looking at.  The road in its gentle curves had\r\nreally brought us to a considerable #NN# hundred feet, as we\r\nafterwards discovered.  Challenger's house was on the very edge of the\r\nhill, and from its #JJ# face, in which was the study window, one\r\nlooked across the vast #NN# of the #NN# to where the gentle curves of\r\nthe South Downs formed an undulating horizon.  In a cleft of the hills a\r\nhaze of smoke marked the position of #NNS#.  Immediately at our feet\r\nthere lay a rolling plain of #NN#, with the long, vivid green\r\nstretches of the #NN# #NN# course, all dotted with the #NNS#.  A\r\nlittle to the south, through an opening in the woods, we could see a\r\nsection of the main line from London to Brighton.  In the immediate\r\nforeground, under our very #NNS#, was a small enclosed #NN#, in which\r\nstood the car which had brought us from the station.",
    "An #NN# from Challenger caused us to turn.  He had read his\r\ntelegrams and had arranged them in a little methodical pile upon his\r\ndesk.  His broad, rugged face, or as much of it as was visible over the\r\nmatted beard, was still deeply flushed, and he seemed to be under the\r\ninfluence of some strong excitement.",
    "\"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, in a voice as if he was addressing a public\r\nmeeting, \"this is indeed an interesting #NN#, and it takes place under\r\n#NN# may say #NN#.  May I ask if you\r\nhave observed anything upon your journey from town?\"",
    "\"The only thing which I observed,\" said Summerlee with a sour smile, \"was\r\nthat our young friend here has not improved in his manners during the\r\nyears that have passed.  I am sorry to state that I have had to seriously\r\ncomplain of his conduct in the train, and I should be wanting in\r\nfrankness if I did not say that it has left a most unpleasant impression\r\nin my mind.\"",
    "\"Well, well, we all #NN# a bit #JJ# sometimes,\" said Lord John.  \"The\r\nyoung fellah meant no real harm.  After all, he's an #JJ#, so if\r\nhe takes half an hour to describe a game of football he has more right to\r\ndo it than most folk.\"",
    "\"Half an hour to describe a game!\" I cried indignantly.  \"Why, it was you\r\nthat took half an hour with some #VBN# story about a buffalo.\r\nProfessor Summerlee will be my witness.\"",
    "\"I can hardly judge which of you was the most utterly #JJ#,\" said\r\nSummerlee.  \"I declare to you, Challenger, that I never wish to hear of\r\nfootball or of #NNS# so long as I live.\"",
    "\"I have never said one word to-day about football,\" I #VBD#.",
    "Lord John gave a shrill whistle, and Summerlee shook his head sadly.",
    "\"So early in the day too,\" said he.  \"It is indeed deplorable.  As I sat\r\nthere in sad but thoughtful #NN#\"",
    "\"In silence!\" cried Lord John.  \"Why, you were doin' a #JJ# turn of\r\n#NNS# all the #NN# like a runaway #NN# than a man.\"",
    "Summerlee drew himself up in bitter protest.",
    "\"You are pleased to be #JJ#, Lord John,\" said he with a face of\r\n#NN#.",
    "\"Why, #NN# it all, this is clear madness,\" cried Lord John.  \"Each of us\r\nseems to know what the others did and none of us knows what he did\r\nhimself.  Let's put it all together from the first.  We got into a\r\nfirst-class smoker, that's clear, ain't it?  Then we began to quarrel\r\nover friend Challenger's letter in the Times.\"",
    "\"Oh, you did, did you?\" rumbled our host, his eyelids beginning to #VBP#.",
    "\"You said, Summerlee, that there was no possible truth in his contention.\"",
    "\"Dear me!\" said Challenger, puffing out his chest and stroking his beard.\r\n\"No possible truth!  I seem to have heard the words before.  And may I\r\nask with what arguments the great and famous Professor Summerlee\r\nproceeded to #VB# the humble individual who had ventured to express\r\nan opinion upon a matter of scientific possibility?  Perhaps before he\r\n#NNS# that unfortunate #NN# he will condescend to give some\r\nreasons for the #JJ# views which he has formed.\"",
    "He bowed and shrugged and spread open his hands as he spoke with his\r\nelaborate and elephantine sarcasm.",
    "\"The reason was simple enough,\" said the #VBN# Summerlee.  \"I #VBD#\r\nthat if the ether surrounding the earth was so toxic in one quarter that\r\nit produced dangerous symptoms, it was hardly likely that we three in the\r\nrailway carriage should be entirely #JJ#.\"",
    "The explanation only brought uproarious merriment from Challenger.  He\r\nlaughed until everything in the room seemed to rattle and quiver.",
    "\"Our worthy Summerlee is, not for the first time, somewhat out of touch\r\nwith the facts of the situation,\" said he at last, #VBG# his heated\r\nbrow.  \"Now, gentlemen, I cannot make my point better than by #VBG#\r\nto you what I have myself done this morning.  You will the more easily\r\n#VB# any mental #NN# upon your own part when you realize that\r\neven I have had moments when my balance has been disturbed.  We have had\r\nfor some years in this household a #NN# Sarah, with whose\r\nsecond name I have never attempted to burden my memory.  She is a woman\r\nof a severe and forbidding aspect, prim and demure in her bearing, very\r\nimpassive in her nature, and never known within our experience to show\r\nsigns of any emotion.  As I sat alone at my #NN#. Challenger is\r\nin the habit of keeping her room of a #NN# suddenly entered my\r\nhead that it would be entertaining and instructive to see whether I could\r\nfind any limits to this woman's #NN#.  I devised a simple but\r\neffective experiment.  Having upset a small #NN# of flowers which stood\r\nin the centre of the cloth, I rang the bell and slipped under the table.\r\nShe entered and, seeing the room empty, imagined that I had withdrawn to\r\nthe study.  As I had expected, she approached and leaned over the table\r\nto #VB# the vase.  I had a vision of a cotton #VBG# and an\r\n#VBN# boot.  #VBG# my head, I sank my teeth into the #NN# of\r\nher leg.  The experiment was successful beyond belief.  For some moments\r\nshe stood paralyzed, staring down at my head.  Then with a shriek she\r\ntore herself free and rushed from the room.  I pursued her with some\r\nthoughts of an explanation, but she flew down the drive, and some minutes\r\nafterwards I was able to pick her out with my #NN# travelling\r\nvery rapidly in a #RB# direction.  I tell you the anecdote for\r\nwhat it is worth.  I drop it into your brains and await its #NN#.\r\nIs it #NN#?  Has it conveyed anything to your minds?  What do\r\n_you_ think of it, Lord John?\"",
    "Lord John shook his head gravely.",
    "\"You'll be gettin' into serious trouble some of these days if you don't\r\nput a brake on,\" said he.",
    "\"Perhaps you have some observation to make, Summerlee?\"",
    "\"You should drop all work instantly, Challenger, and take three months in\r\na German #NN#,\" said he.",
    "\"#JJ#!  Profound!\" cried Challenger.  \"Now, my young friend, is it\r\npossible that wisdom may come from you where your seniors have so\r\n#RB# failed?\"",
    "And it did.  I say it with all modesty, but it did.  Of course, it all\r\nseems obvious enough to you who know what occurred, but it was not so\r\nvery clear when everything was new.  But it came on me suddenly with the\r\nfull force of absolute conviction.",
    "\"#NN#!\" I cried.",
    "Then, even as I said the word, my mind flashed back over the whole\r\nmorning's experiences, past Lord John with his buffalo, past my own\r\nhysterical tears, past the outrageous conduct of Professor Summerlee, to\r\nthe queer happenings in London, the row in the park, the driving of the\r\nchauffeur, the quarrel at the oxygen #NN#.  Everything fitted\r\nsuddenly into its place.",
    "\"Of course,\" I cried again.  \"It is poison.  We are all poisoned.\"",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Challenger, rubbing his hands, \"we are all poisoned.  Our\r\nplanet has #VBN# into the poison belt of ether, and is now flying deeper\r\ninto it at the rate of some millions of miles a minute.  Our young friend\r\nhas expressed the cause of all our troubles and #NNS# in a single\r\nword, 'poison.'\"",
    "We looked at each other in amazed silence.  No #NN# seemed to meet the\r\nsituation.",
    "\"There is a mental #NN# by which such symptoms can be #VBN# and\r\ncontrolled,\" said Challenger.  \"I cannot expect to find it developed in\r\nall of you to the same point which it has reached in me, for I suppose\r\nthat the strength of our different mental processes bears some proportion\r\nto each other.  But no doubt it is appreciable even in our young friend\r\nhere.  After the little outburst of high spirits which so alarmed my\r\ndomestic I sat down and #VBD# with myself.  I put it to myself that I\r\nhad never before felt #VBN# to bite any of my household.  The impulse\r\nhad then been an #JJ# one.  In an instant I perceived the truth.  My\r\npulse upon examination was ten #VBZ# above the usual, and my #NNS#\r\nwere increased.  I called upon my higher and #JJR# self, the real G. E.\r\nC., seated serene and impregnable behind all mere #JJ# disturbance.\r\nI summoned him, I say, to watch the foolish mental tricks which the\r\npoison would play.  I found that I was indeed the master.  I could\r\nrecognize and control a disordered mind.  It was a remarkable exhibition\r\nof the victory of mind over matter, for it was a victory over that\r\nparticular form of matter which is most #RB# connected with mind.\r\nI might almost say that mind was at fault and that personality controlled\r\nit.  Thus, when my wife came downstairs and I was impelled to slip behind\r\nthe door and alarm her by some wild cry as she entered, I was able to\r\n#VB# the impulse and to #VB# her with dignity and restraint.  An\r\noverpowering desire to #NN# like a #NN# was met and mastered in the same\r\nfashion.",
    "\"#RB#, when I descended to order the car and found Austin bending over\r\nit absorbed in #NNS#, I controlled my open hand even after I had lifted\r\nit and refrained from giving him an experience which would possibly have\r\ncaused him to follow in the steps of the housekeeper.  On the contrary, I\r\ntouched him on the shoulder and ordered the car to be at the door in time\r\nto meet your train.  At the present instant I am most #RB# tempted to\r\ntake Professor Summerlee by that silly old beard of his and to shake his\r\nhead violently backwards and forwards.  And yet, as you see, I am\r\nperfectly #VBN#.  Let me #VB# my example to you.\"",
    "\"I'll look out for that buffalo,\" said Lord John.",
    "\"And I for the football match.\"",
    "\"It may be that you are right, Challenger,\" said Summerlee in a #VBN#\r\nvoice.  \"I am willing to admit that my turn of mind is critical rather\r\nthan #JJ# and that I am not a ready #VB# to any new theory,\r\nespecially when it happens to be so unusual and fantastic as this one.\r\nHowever, as I cast my mind back over the events of the morning, and as I\r\n#VB# the fatuous conduct of my companions, I find it easy to\r\nbelieve that some poison of an #JJ# kind was responsible for their\r\nsymptoms.\"",
    "Challenger slapped his colleague #RB# upon the shoulder.  \"We\r\nprogress,\" said he.  \"#RB# we progress.\"",
    "\"And pray, sir,\" asked Summerlee humbly, \"what is your opinion as to the\r\npresent #NN#?\"",
    "\"With your permission I will say a few words upon that subject.\" He\r\nseated himself upon his desk, his short, #JJ# legs #VBG# in front of\r\nhim.  \"We are assisting at a tremendous and awful #NN#.  It is, in my\r\nopinion, the end of the world.\"",
    "The end of the world!  Our eyes turned to the great #NN# and we\r\nlooked out at the summer beauty of the #NN#, the long slopes of\r\nheather, the great #NN#, the #JJ# #NNS#, the #NN#\r\nupon the links.",
    "The end of the world!  One had often heard the words, but the idea that\r\nthey could ever have an immediate practical significance, that it should\r\nnot be at some vague date, but now, to-day, that was a tremendous, a\r\nstaggering thought.  We were all #NN# solemn and waited in silence for\r\nChallenger to continue.  His overpowering presence and appearance lent\r\nsuch force to the solemnity of his words that for a moment all the\r\n#NNS# and #NNS# of the man vanished, and he loomed before us as\r\nsomething majestic and beyond the range of ordinary humanity.  Then to\r\nme, at least, there came back the cheering recollection of how twice\r\nsince we had entered the room he had roared with laughter.  Surely, I\r\nthought, there are limits to mental detachment.  The crisis cannot be so\r\ngreat or so pressing after all.",
    "\"You will conceive a bunch of #NNS#,\" said he, \"which are covered by\r\nsome #JJ# but #JJ# #NNS#.  The gardener passes it through\r\na #VBG# medium.  It may be that he desires his grapes to be\r\ncleaner.  It may be that he needs space to breed some fresh bacillus less\r\nnoxious than the last.  He #NNS# it into the poison and they are gone.\r\nOur #NN# is, in my opinion, about to #NN# the #JJ# system, and the\r\nhuman bacillus, the little #JJ# #NN# which twisted and wriggled upon\r\nthe outer #NN# of the earth, will in an instant be #VBN# out of\r\nexistence.\"",
    "Again there was silence.  It was broken by the high #NN# of the\r\ntelephone-bell.",
    "\"There is one of our #NN# #VBG# for help,\" said he with a grim\r\nsmile.  \"They are beginning to realize that their continued existence is\r\nnot really one of the #NNS# of the universe.\"",
    "He was gone from the room for a minute or two.  I remember that none of\r\nus spoke in his absence.  The situation seemed beyond all words or\r\ncomments.",
    "\"The medical officer of health for Brighton,\" said he when he returned.\r\n\"The symptoms are for some reason #VBG# more rapidly upon the sea\r\nlevel.  Our seven hundred feet of #NN# give us an advantage.  #NNP#\r\nseem to have learned that I am the first authority upon the question.  No\r\ndoubt it comes from my letter in the Times.  That was the #NN# of a\r\n#JJ# town with whom I talked when we first arrived.  You may have\r\nheard me upon the telephone.  He seemed to put an entirely inflated value\r\nupon his own life.  I helped him to #VB# his ideas.\"",
    "Summerlee had risen and was standing by the window.  His thin, bony hands\r\nwere trembling with his emotion.",
    "\"Challenger,\" said he earnestly, \"this thing is too serious for mere\r\nfutile argument.  Do not suppose that I desire to #VB# you by any\r\nquestion I may ask.  But I put it to you whether there may not be some\r\nfallacy in your information or in your reasoning.  There is the sun\r\nshining as brightly as ever in the blue sky.  There are the heather and\r\nthe flowers and the birds.  There are the folk #VBG# themselves upon\r\nthe #NNS# and the #NNS# yonder cutting the #NN#.  You tell us\r\nthat they and we may be upon the very #NN# of #NN# this\r\n#NN# day may be that day of #NN# which the human race has so long\r\nawaited.  So far as we know, you found this tremendous judgment upon\r\nwhat?  Upon some abnormal lines in a #NN# #NNS# from\r\n#NN# some curious personal excitement which we have #VBN# in\r\neach other.  This latter #NN# is not so marked but that you and we\r\ncould, by a deliberate effort, control it.  You need not stand on\r\nceremony with us, Challenger.  We have all faced death together before\r\nnow.  #VB# out, and let us know exactly where we stand, and what, in\r\nyour opinion, are our prospects for our future.\"",
    "It was a brave, good speech, a speech from that #VB# and strong spirit\r\nwhich lay behind all the #NNS# and #NNS# of the old zoologist.\r\nLord John rose and shook him by the hand.",
    "\"My sentiment to a #NN#,\" said he.  \"Now, Challenger, it's up to you to\r\ntell us where we are.  We ain't nervous folk, as you know well; but when\r\nit comes to #NN#' a week-end visit and finding you've run full butt into\r\nthe Day of #NNP#, it wants a bit of #NN#'.  What's the danger,\r\nand how much of it is there, and what are we goin' to do to meet it?\"",
    "He stood, tall and strong, in the sunshine at the window, with his brown\r\nhand upon the shoulder of Summerlee.  I was lying back in an armchair, an\r\n#VBN# cigarette between my lips, in that sort of #VBN# state\r\nin which impressions become exceedingly distinct.  It may have been a new\r\n#NN# of the poisoning, but the delirious #NNS# had all passed away\r\nand were succeeded by an exceedingly #JJ# and, at the same time,\r\n#JJ# state of mind.  I was a #NN#.  It did not seem to be any\r\npersonal concern of mine.  But here were three strong men at a great\r\ncrisis, and it was #JJ# to observe them.  Challenger bent his\r\nheavy brows and stroked his beard before he answered.  One could see that\r\nhe was very carefully #VBG# his words.",
    "\"What was the last news when you left London?\" he asked.",
    "\"I was at the Gazette office about ten,\" said I.  \"There was a Reuter\r\njust come in from Singapore to the effect that the sickness seemed to be\r\nuniversal in Sumatra and that the lighthouses had not been lit in\r\nconsequence.\"",
    "\"#NNS# have been moving somewhat rapidly since then,\" said Challenger,\r\npicking up his pile of telegrams.  \"I am in close touch both with the\r\nauthorities and with the press, so that news is #VBG# upon me from\r\nall parts.  There is, in fact, a general and very insistent demand that I\r\nshould come to London; but I see no good end to be served.  From the\r\naccounts the poisonous effect begins with mental excitement; the #VBG#\r\nin Paris this morning is said to have been very violent, and the #NNP#\r\n#NNS# are in a state of uproar.  So far as the evidence to hand can be\r\ntrusted, this #JJ# stage, which varies much in races and in\r\nindividuals, is succeeded by a certain #NN# and mental #NN#\r\nseem to discern some signs of it in our young friend #NN#, after\r\nan appreciable interval, turns to #NN#, #VBG# rapidly into death.  I\r\nfancy, so far as my toxicology #VBZ# me, that there are some vegetable\r\nnerve #NN#\"",
    "\"#NN#,\" suggested Summerlee.",
    "\"Excellent!\" cried Challenger.  \"It would make for scientific #NN#\r\nif we named our toxic agent.  Let it be #NN#.  To you, my dear\r\nSummerlee, belongs the #NN#, #UH#, but none the less\r\n#NN# having given a name to the universal #NN#, the Great\r\nGardener's #NN#.  The symptoms of daturon, then, may be taken to\r\nbe such as I indicate.  That it will involve the whole world and that no\r\nlife can possibly remain behind seems to me to be certain, since ether is\r\na universal medium.  Up to now it has been #JJ# in the places which\r\nit has attacked, but the difference is only a matter of a few hours, and\r\nit is like an advancing #NN# which covers one #NN# of sand and then\r\nanother, running #RB# and #RB# in irregular #NNS#, until at last\r\nit has submerged it all.  There are laws at work in connection with the\r\naction and #NN# of daturon which would have been of deep interest\r\nhad the time at our disposal #VBN# us to study them.  So far as I can\r\ntrace them\"--here he glanced over his #NN#\"the less developed\r\nraces have been the first to respond to its influence.  There are\r\ndeplorable accounts from Africa, and the Australian #NNS# appear to\r\nhave been already exterminated.  The #NNP# races have as yet shown\r\ngreater #VBG# power than the #NNP#.  This, you see, is dated from\r\n#NNP# at #NN# this morning.  I give it to you verbatim:--",
    "\"'All night delirious excitement throughout #NN#.  #NN# of #NN#\r\n#NNS# at #NNS#.  #JJ# upheaval at #NN#.  #JJ# illness\r\n#VBD# by coma attacked #NN# this morning.  #NN# #NN#.\r\nGreat numbers of dead in the streets.  #NN# of business and\r\nuniversal chaos.'",
    "\"An hour later came the following, from the same source:--",
    "\"'We are threatened with utter #NN#.  #NNS# and #NNS#\r\nfull to #VBG#.  The dead #VBP# the living.  It is inconceivable\r\nand horrible.  #NN# seems to be #JJ#, but swift and inevitable.'",
    "\"There is a similar telegram from Paris, where the development is not yet\r\nas acute.  India and #NNP# appear to be utterly #VBD# out.  The #NN#\r\npopulation of #NNP# is down, while the #JJ# has hardly been\r\naffected.  #VBG# generally, the #NNS# upon the plains and upon the\r\n#NN# seem, so far as my limited information goes, to have felt the\r\neffects more rapidly than those inland or on the heights.  Even a little\r\nelevation makes a considerable difference, and perhaps if there be a\r\n#NN# of the human race, he will again be found upon the summit of\r\nsome #NN#.  Even our own little hill may presently prove to be a\r\ntemporary #NN# amid a sea of disaster.  But at the present rate of\r\nadvance a few short hours will #VB# us all.\"",
    "Lord John Roxton wiped his brow.",
    "\"What beats me,\" said he, \"is how you could sit there laughin' with that\r\n#NN# of telegrams under your hand.  I've seen death as often as most\r\nfolk, but universal #NN#'s awful!\"",
    "\"As to the laughter,\" said Challenger, \"you will bear in mind that, like\r\nyourselves, I have not been #JJ# from the stimulating cerebral effects\r\nof the etheric poison.  But as to the horror with which universal death\r\nappears to #VB# you, I would put it to you that it is somewhat\r\nexaggerated.  If you were sent to sea alone in an open boat to some\r\nunknown destination, your heart might well #VB# within you.  The\r\n#NN#, the #NN#, would #VB# you.  But if your voyage were\r\nmade in a goodly ship, which bore within it all your relations and your\r\nfriends, you would feel that, however uncertain your destination might\r\nstill remain, you would at least have one common and #JJ#\r\nexperience which would hold you to the end in the same close #NN#.\r\nA lonely death may be terrible, but a universal one, as painless as this\r\nwould appear to be, is not, in my judgment, a matter for apprehension.\r\nIndeed, I could sympathize with the person who took the view that the\r\nhorror lay in the idea of surviving when all that is learned, famous, and\r\nexalted had passed away.\"",
    "\"What, then, do you propose to do?\" asked Summerlee, who had for once\r\nnodded his assent to the reasoning of his brother scientist.",
    "\"To take our lunch,\" said Challenger as the #NN# of a #NN# sounded\r\nthrough the house.  \"We have a cook whose #NNS# are only #VBD# by\r\nher #NNS#.  We can but trust that no cosmic disturbance has #VBN# her\r\nexcellent #NNS#.  My #NN# of '#CD# must also be rescued, so far\r\nas our earnest and united efforts can do it, from what would be a\r\ndeplorable waste of a great #JJ#.\"  He levered his great bulk off the\r\ndesk, upon which he had sat while he announced the doom of the planet.\r\n\"Come,\" said he.  \"If there is little time left, there is the more need\r\nthat we should spend it in #JJ# and reasonable #NN#.\"",
    "And, indeed, it proved to be a very merry meal.  It is true that we could\r\nnot forget our awful situation.  The full solemnity of the event loomed\r\never at the back of our minds and tempered our thoughts.  But surely it\r\nis the soul which has never faced death which #VBZ# strongly from it at\r\nthe end.  To each of us men it had, for one great epoch in our lives,\r\nbeen a familiar presence.  As to the lady, she leaned upon the strong\r\nguidance of her mighty husband and was well content to go #NN# his\r\npath might lead.  The future was our fate.  The present was our own.  We\r\npassed it in goodly comradeship and gentle merriment.  Our minds were, as\r\nI have said, singularly lucid.  Even I struck #VBZ# at times.  As to\r\nChallenger, he was wonderful!  Never have I so realized the #JJ#\r\ngreatness of the man, the sweep and power of his understanding.\r\nSummerlee drew him on with his chorus of #NN# criticism, while Lord\r\nJohn and I laughed at the contest and the lady, her hand upon his sleeve,\r\ncontrolled the #NNS# of the philosopher.  Life, death, fate, the\r\ndestiny of #NN# were the stupendous #NNS# of that memorable\r\nhour, made vital by the fact that as the meal #VBD# strange, sudden\r\n#NNS# in my mind and #NNS# in my limbs #VBD# that the\r\ninvisible tide of death was slowly and gently rising around us.  Once I\r\nsaw Lord John put his hand suddenly to his eyes, and once Summerlee\r\ndropped back for an instant in his chair.  Each breath we breathed was\r\n#VBN# with strange forces.  And yet our minds were happy and at ease.\r\nPresently Austin laid the cigarettes upon the table and was about to\r\nwithdraw.",
    "\"Austin!\" said his master.",
    "\"Yes, sir?\"",
    "\"I thank you for your faithful service.\"  A smile stole over the\r\nservant's gnarled face.",

    "\"I'm expecting the end of the world to-day, Austin.\"",
    "\"Yes, sir.  What time, sir?\"",
    "\"I can't say, Austin.  Before evening.\"",
    "\"Very good, sir.\"",
    "The taciturn Austin #VBD# and withdrew.  Challenger lit a cigarette,\r\nand, drawing his chair closer to his wife's, he took her hand in his.",
    "\"You know how matters stand, dear,\" said he.  \"I have explained it also\r\nto our friends here.  You're not afraid are you?\"",
    "\"It won't be painful, George?\"",
    "\"No more than #NNS# at the #NN#'s.  Every time you have had it\r\nyou have practically died.\"",
    "\"But that is a pleasant sensation.\"",
    "\"So may death be.  The #JJ# bodily machine can't record its\r\nimpression, but we know the mental pleasure which lies in a dream or a\r\n#NN#.

How does\r\nit strike you, Herr Professor?\"",
    "\"Well,\" said Summerlee, \"since you ask my opinion, it strikes me as an\r\n#JJ# #NN# to the Stone #NNP# or before it.

I don't know that I am more afraid of death than the rest\r\nof you, for I am an #NN# man, and, come what may, I can't have very\r\nmuch longer to live; but it is all against my nature to sit waiting\r\nwithout a struggle like a #NN# for the butcher.  Is it quite certain,\r\nChallenger, that there is nothing we can do?\"",
    "\"To save #VBG#,\" said Challenger.  \"To prolong our lives a few\r\nhours and thus to see the evolution of this mighty tragedy before we are\r\nactually involved in #NN# may prove to be within my powers.  I have\r\ntaken certain #NN#\"",

    "\"Exactly.  The oxygen.\"",
    "\"But what can oxygen effect in the face of a poisoning of the ether?\r\nThere is not a greater difference in quality between a #NN# and a\r\ngas than there is between oxygen and ether.

    "\"Well,\" said Lord John, \"if we've got to sit #NN#' at those tubes like\r\nso many babies with their bottles, I'm not takin' any.\"",

    "\"Really, my worthy friend, you are a trifle #JJ# in missing the\r\npoint.  It is not to keep out the ether that we have gone to such\r\ntrouble.  It is to keep in the oxygen.  I trust that if we can ensure an\r\natmosphere #VBN# to a certain point, we may be able to retain\r\nour senses.  I had two tubes of the gas and you have brought me three\r\nmore.  It is not much, but it is something.\"",
    "\"How long will they last?\"",
    "\"I have not an idea.  We will not turn them on until our symptoms become\r\n#JJ#.  Then we shall #VB# the gas out as it is #RB# needed.

    "The #NN# which was destined to be the scene of our unforgettable\r\nexperience was a #RB# #JJ# sitting-room, some #NN# or\r\n#NN# feet square.  At the end of it, divided by a curtain of red\r\nvelvet, was a small apartment which formed the Professor's #NN#.\r\nThis in turn opened into a large bedroom.  The curtain was still hanging,\r\nbut the boudoir and dressing-room could be taken as one chamber for the\r\npurposes of our experiment.  One door and the window frame had been\r\nplastered round with varnished paper so as to be practically sealed.\r\nAbove the other door, which opened on to the landing, there hung a\r\nfanlight which could be drawn by a cord when some ventilation became\r\nabsolutely necessary.

At the same time,\r\nit would be well not to go far from the room, as the crisis may be a\r\nsudden and urgent one.\"",
    "There was a broad, low window opening out upon a #NN#.  The view\r\nbeyond was the same as that which we had already #VBD# from the study.\r\nLooking out, I could see no sign of disorder anywhere.  There was a road\r\ncurving down the side of the hill, under my very eyes.

    "From time to time during and after lunch the high, insistent ring had\r\nsummoned the Professor.  He gave us the news as it came through to him in\r\na few #JJ# sentences.  Such terrific #NNS# had never been #VBN# in\r\nthe world's history before.  The great shadow was #VBG# up from the\r\nsouth like a rising tide of death.

North of #NNP# the\r\neffect was not yet marked, and in Canada it was hardly perceptible.\r\nBelgium, Holland, and #NNP# had each in turn been affected.  #JJ#\r\nmessages were flashing from every quarter to the great centres of\r\n#VBG#, to the #NNS# and the doctors of #JJ# repute, imploring\r\ntheir advice.

It was #NN# but #NN# for young and old,\r\nfor weak and strong, for rich and poor, without hope or possibility of\r\nescape.  Such was the news which, in scattered, #VBN# messages, the\r\ntelephone had brought us.  The great #NNS# already knew their fate and\r\nso far as we could gather were #VBG# to meet it with dignity and\r\nresignation.  Yet here were our golfers and laborers like the #NNS# who\r\n#NN# under the shadow of the knife.  It seemed amazing.  And yet how\r\ncould they know?  It had all come upon us in one giant #NN#.  What was\r\nthere in the morning paper to alarm them?  And now it was but three in\r\nthe afternoon.  Even as we looked some rumour seemed to have spread, for\r\nwe saw the #NNS# hurrying from the fields.  Some of the golfers were\r\nreturning to the #NN#.  They were running as if taking refuge from\r\na shower.  Their little #NNS# #VBD# behind them.  #NNS# were\r\ncontinuing their game.  The nurse had turned and was pushing her\r\nperambulator hurriedly up the hill again.  I noticed that she had her\r\nhand to her brow.  The cab had stopped and the tired horse, with his head\r\nsunk to his knees, was #VBG#.  Above there was a perfect summer\r\n#NN# huge #NN# of unbroken blue, save for a few #NN# white clouds\r\nover the distant #NNS#.  If the human race must die to-day, it was at\r\nleast upon a glorious #VBN#.  And yet all that gentle #NN# of\r\nnature made this terrific and #JJ# destruction the more #JJ# and\r\nawful.  Surely it was too goodly a residence that we should be so\r\nswiftly, so #RB#, #VBN# from it!",
    "But I have said that the telephone-bell had rung once more.  Suddenly I\r\nheard Challenger's tremendous voice from the hall.",
    "\"Malone!\" he cried.  \"You are wanted.\"",
    "I rushed down to the instrument.  It was McArdle speaking from London.",
    "\"That you, Mr. Malone?\" cried his familiar voice.  \"Mr. Malone, there are\r\nterrible goings-on in London.  For God's sake, see if Professor\r\nChallenger can suggest anything that can be done.\"",
    "\"He can suggest nothing, sir,\" I answered.  \"He regards the crisis as\r\nuniversal and inevitable.  We have some oxygen here, but it can only\r\n#VB# our fate for a few hours.\"",
    "\"Oxygen!\" cried the #VBN# voice.  \"There is no time to get any.  The\r\noffice has been a perfect #NN# ever since you left in the morning.\r\nNow half of the staff are insensible.  I am weighed down with #NN#\r\nmyself.  From my window I can see the people lying thick in Fleet Street.\r\nThe traffic is all held up.  Judging by the last telegrams, the whole\r\n#NN#\"",
    "His voice had been sinking, and suddenly stopped.  An instant later I\r\nheard through the telephone a muffled thud, as if his head had fallen\r\nforward on the desk.",
    "\"Mr. McArdle!\" I cried.  \"Mr. McArdle!\"",
    "There was no answer.  I knew as I replaced the receiver that I should\r\nnever hear his voice again.",
    "At that instant, just as I took a step backwards from the telephone, the\r\nthing was on us.  It was as if we were #NNS#, up to our shoulders in\r\nwater, who suddenly are submerged by a rolling wave.  An invisible hand\r\nseemed to have quietly closed round my throat and to be gently pressing\r\nthe life from me.  I was conscious of immense #NN# upon my chest,\r\ngreat #NN# within my head, a loud singing in my ears, and bright\r\n#NNS# before my eyes.  I staggered to the #NN# of the stair.  At\r\nthe same moment, rushing and #VBG# like a wounded buffalo, Challenger\r\ndashed past me, a terrible vision, with #NN# face, #VBN# eyes,\r\nand bristling hair.  His little wife, insensible to all appearance, was\r\nslung over his great shoulder, and he #VBD# and #VBD# up the\r\nstair, #VBG# and tripping, but carrying himself and her through\r\nsheer #NN# through that mephitic atmosphere to the haven of\r\ntemporary safety.  At the sight of his effort I too rushed up the steps,\r\n#VBG#, falling, #VBG# at the rail, until I #VBD# half\r\nsenseless upon by face on the upper landing.  Lord John's fingers of\r\n#NN# were in the collar of my coat, and a moment later I was stretched\r\nupon my back, unable to speak or move, on the boudoir carpet.  The woman\r\nlay beside me, and Summerlee was bunched in a chair by the window, his\r\nhead nearly touching his knees.  As in a dream I saw Challenger, like a\r\nmonstrous beetle, crawling slowly across the floor, and a moment later I\r\nheard the gentle hissing of the #VBG# oxygen.  Challenger breathed two\r\nor three times with enormous #NNS#, his lungs roaring as he drew in the\r\nvital gas.",
    "\"It works!\" he cried exultantly.  \"My reasoning has been justified!\" He\r\nwas up on his feet again, alert and strong.  With a tube in his hand he\r\nrushed over to his wife and held it to her face.  In a few seconds she\r\n#VBD#, stirred, and sat up.  He turned to me, and I felt the tide of\r\nlife stealing warmly through my #NNS#.  My reason told me that it was\r\nbut a little #NN#, and yet, carelessly as we talk of its value, every\r\nhour of existence now seemed an inestimable thing.  Never have I known\r\nsuch a thrill of sensuous joy as came with that #NN# of life.  The\r\nweight fell away from my lungs, the band loosened from my brow, a sweet\r\nfeeling of peace and gentle, languid comfort stole over me.  I lay\r\nwatching Summerlee #VB# under the same #NN#, and finally Lord John\r\ntook his turn.  He sprang to his feet and gave me a hand to rise, while\r\nChallenger picked up his wife and laid her on the settee.",
    "\"Oh, George, I am so sorry you brought me back,\" she said, holding him by\r\nthe hand.  \"The door of death is indeed, as you said, hung with\r\nbeautiful, shimmering #NNS#; for, once the #VBG# feeling had passed,\r\nit was all #RB# soothing and beautiful.  Why have you dragged me\r\nback?\"",
    "\"Because I wish that we make the passage together.  We have been together\r\nso many years.  It would be sad to fall apart at the supreme moment.\"",
    "For a moment in his #NN# voice I caught a glimpse of a new Challenger,\r\nsomething very far from the #VBG#, #VBG#, #JJ# man who had\r\nalternately amazed and offended his generation.  Here in the shadow of\r\ndeath was the #JJ# Challenger, the man who had won and held a\r\nwoman's love.  Suddenly his mood changed and he was our strong captain\r\nonce again.",
    "\"Alone of all mankind I saw and foretold this catastrophe,\" said he with\r\na ring of exultation and scientific triumph in his voice.  \"As to you, my\r\ngood Summerlee, I trust your last doubts have been resolved as to the\r\nmeaning of the blurring of the lines in the spectrum and that you will no\r\nlonger #VBP# that my letter in the Times was based upon a #NN#.\"",
    "For once our #JJ# colleague was #JJ# to a #NN#.  He could but\r\nsit gasping and stretching his long, thin limbs, as if to assure himself\r\nthat he was still really upon this planet.  Challenger walked across to\r\nthe oxygen tube, and the sound of the loud hissing fell away till it was\r\nthe most gentle #NN#.",
    "\"We must husband our supply of the gas,\" said he.  \"The atmosphere of the\r\nroom is now strongly #VBN#, and I take it that none of us feel\r\nany #JJ# symptoms.  We can only determine by actual experiments\r\nwhat amount added to the air will serve to #VB# the poison.  Let us\r\nsee how that will do.\"",
    "We sat in silent nervous tension for five minutes or more, observing our\r\nown #NNS#.  I had just begun to fancy that I felt the #NN#\r\nround my temples again when Mrs. Challenger called out from the sofa that\r\nshe was #VBG#.  Her husband turned on more gas.",
    "\"In #NN# days,\" said he, \"they used to keep a white mouse in\r\nevery submarine, as its more delicate #NN# gave signs of a\r\nvicious atmosphere before it was perceived by the sailors.  You, my dear,\r\nwill be our white mouse.  I have now increased the supply and you are\r\nbetter.\"",
    "\"Yes, I am better.\"",
    "\"Possibly we have hit upon the correct mixture.  When we have ascertained\r\nexactly how little will serve we shall be able to #VB# how long we\r\nshall be able to exist.  Unfortunately, in #VBG# ourselves we\r\nhave already consumed a considerable proportion of this first tube.\"",
    "\"Does it matter?\" asked Lord John, who was standing with his hands in his\r\npockets close to the window.  \"If we have to go, what is the use of\r\n#VBG#' on?  You don't suppose there's any chance for us?\"",
    "Challenger smiled and shook his head.",
    "\"Well, then, don't you think there is more dignity in takin' the jump and\r\nnot waitin' to be pushed in?  If it must be so, I'm for sayin' our\r\n#NNS#, #NN#' off the gas, and #NN#' the window.\"",
    "\"Why not?\" said the lady #RB#.  \"Surely, George, Lord John is right\r\nand it is better so.\"",
    "\"I most strongly object,\" cried Summerlee in a querulous voice.  \"When we\r\nmust die let us by all means die, but to deliberately anticipate death\r\nseems to me to be a foolish and unjustifiable action.\"",
    "\"What does our young friend say to it?\" asked Challenger.",
    "\"I think we should see it to the end.\"",
    "\"And I am strongly of the same opinion,\" said he.",
    "\"Then, George, if you say so, I think so too,\" cried the lady.",
    "\"Well, well, I'm only #NN#' it as an argument,\" said Lord John.  \"If\r\nyou all want to see it through I am with you.  It's #VBN# interestin',\r\nand no mistake about that.  I've had my share of adventures in my life,\r\nand as many thrills as most folk, but I'm #NN#' on my top note.\"",
    "\"#VBG# the #NN# of life,\" said Challenger.",
    "\"A large #NN#!\" cried Summerlee.  Challenger stared at him in\r\nsilent reproof.",
    "\"Granting the continuity of life,\" said he, in his most #JJ# manner,\r\n\"none of us can #NN# what opportunities of observation one may have\r\nfrom what we may call the spirit #NN# to the plane of matter.  It surely\r\nmust be evident to the most obtuse person\" (here he glared a Summerlee)\r\n\"that it is while we are ourselves material that we are most fitted to\r\nwatch and form a judgment upon material #NNS#.  Therefore it is only\r\nby keeping alive for these few extra hours that we can hope to carry on\r\nwith us to some future existence a clear conception of the most\r\nstupendous event that the world, or the universe so far as we know it,\r\nhas ever encountered.  To me it would seem a deplorable thing that we\r\nshould in any way curtail by so much as a minute so wonderful an\r\nexperience.\"",
    "\"I am strongly of the same opinion,\" cried Summerlee.",
    "\"#VBN# without a division,\" said Lord John.  \"By George, that poor\r\ndevil of a chauffeur of yours down in the yard has made his last journey.\r\nNo use makin' a #RB# and #NN#' him in?\"",
    "\"It would be absolute madness,\" cried Summerlee.",
    "\"Well, I suppose it would,\" said Lord John.  \"It couldn't help him and\r\nwould #VB# our gas all over the house, even if we ever got back alive.\r\nMy word, look at the little birds under the trees!\"",
    "We drew four chairs up to the long, low window, the lady still resting\r\nwith closed eyes upon the settee.  I remember that the monstrous and\r\ngrotesque idea crossed my #NN# #NN# may have been #VBN# by\r\nthe heavy stuffiness of the air which we were #NN# we were in\r\nfour front seats of the #NNS# at the last act of the drama of the world.",
    "In the immediate foreground, beneath our very eyes, was the small yard\r\nwith the #VBN# motor-car standing in it.  Austin, the chauffeur,\r\nhad received his final notice at last, for he was sprawling beside the\r\n#NN#, with a great black #NN# upon his forehead where it had struck\r\nthe step or #NN# in falling.  He still held in his hand the #NN#\r\nof the #NN# with which he had been #VBG# down his machine.  A couple of\r\nsmall plane trees stood in the corner of the yard, and #IN# them\r\nlay several #JJ# little #NNS# of fluffy feathers, with tiny feet\r\nuplifted.  The sweep of death's #NN# had #VBD# everything, great and\r\nsmall, within its #NN#.",
    "#IN# the wall of the yard we looked down upon the winding road, which led\r\nto the station.  A group of the reapers whom we had seen running from the\r\nfields were lying all #NN#, their bodies #VBG# each other, at the\r\nbottom of it.  #RB# up, the #NN# lay with her head and shoulders\r\n#VBN# against the slope of the grassy bank.  She had taken the baby\r\nfrom the perambulator, and it was a motionless bundle of wraps in her\r\narms.  Close behind her a tiny patch upon the #NN# showed where the\r\nlittle boy was stretched.  Still nearer to us was the dead #NN#,\r\nkneeling between the #NNS#.  The old driver was hanging over the\r\n#NN# like some grotesque #NN#, his arms dangling absurdly in\r\nfront of him.  Through the window we could dimly discern that a young man\r\nwas seated inside.  The door was swinging open and his hand was grasping\r\nthe handle, as if he had attempted to #NN# forth at the last instant.  In\r\nthe middle distance lay the golf links, dotted as they had been in the\r\nmorning with the dark figures of the golfers, lying motionless upon the\r\ngrass of the course or among the heather which skirted it.  On one\r\nparticular green there were eight bodies stretched where a #NN# with\r\nits caddies had held to their game to the last.  No bird flew in the blue\r\nvault of heaven, no man or beast moved upon the vast countryside which\r\nlay before us.  The evening sun shone its peaceful radiance across it,\r\nbut there #VBD# over it all the stillness and the silence of universal\r\n#NN# death in which we were so soon to join.  At the present instant\r\nthat one frail sheet of glass, by holding in the extra oxygen which\r\n#VBN# the poisoned ether, shut us off from the fate of all our\r\nkind.  For a few short hours the knowledge and #NN# of one man could\r\npreserve our little #NN# of life in the vast desert of death and save us\r\nfrom participation in the common catastrophe.  Then the gas would run\r\nlow, we too should lie gasping upon that #VBN# boudoir carpet,\r\nand the fate of the human race and of all #RB# life would be complete.\r\nFor a long time, in a mood which was too solemn for speech, we looked out\r\nat the tragic world.",
    "\"There is a house on fire,\" said Challenger at last, pointing to a column\r\nof smoke which rose above the trees.  \"There will, I expect, be many\r\n#RB# whole cities in #NN# we consider how many folk may\r\nhave dropped with lights in their hands.  The fact of combustion is in\r\nitself enough to show that the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere is\r\nnormal and that it is the ether which is at fault.  Ah, there you see\r\nanother blaze on the top of Crowborough Hill.  It is the golf #NN#,\r\nor I am mistaken.  There is the church clock #VBG# the hour.  It would\r\ninterest our #NNS# to know that #JJ# #NNS# have survived\r\nthe race who made it.\"",
    "\"By George!\" cried Lord John, rising excitedly from his chair.  \"What's\r\nthat #NN# of smoke?  It's a train.\"",
    "We heard the roar of it, and presently it came flying into sight, going\r\nat what seemed to me to be a prodigious speed.  #WRB# it had come, or\r\nhow far, we had no means of knowing.  Only by some #NN# of luck could\r\nit have gone any distance.  But now we were to see the terrific end of\r\nits career.  A train of coal #NNS# stood motionless upon the line.  We\r\nheld our breath as the #NN# roared along the same track.  The crash\r\nwas horrible.  #NNP# and carriages piled themselves into a hill of\r\nsplintered wood and twisted iron.  Red #NNS# of flame flickered up from\r\nthe #NN# until it was all #JJ#.  For half an hour we sat with\r\nhardly a word, stunned by the stupendous sight.",
    "\"Poor, poor people!\" cried Mrs. Challenger at last, clinging with a\r\n#NN# to her husband's arm.",
    "\"My dear, the #NNS# on that train were no more #JJ# than the\r\n#NNS# into which they crashed or the carbon which they have now become,\"\r\nsaid Challenger, stroking her hand #RB#.  \"It was a train of the\r\nliving when it left Victoria, but it was driven and #VBN# by the dead\r\nlong before it reached its fate.\"",
    "\"All over the world the same thing must be going on,\" said I as a vision\r\nof strange happenings rose before me.  \"Think of the ships at #NN#\r\nthey will steam on and on, until the #NNS# die down or until they run\r\nfull tilt upon some beach.  The sailing ships #NN# they will back and\r\nfill with their cargoes of dead sailors, while their #NNS# #NN# and\r\ntheir #NNS# leak, till one by one they sink below the surface.  Perhaps\r\na century hence the Atlantic may still be dotted with the old drifting\r\n#NNS#.\"",
    "\"And the folk in the #NNS#,\" said Summerlee with a #JJ# chuckle.\r\n\"If ever #NNS# should by any chance live upon earth again they will\r\nhave some strange theories of the existence of man in #NNS#\r\n#NNS#.\"",
    "\"I don't profess to know about such things,\" remarked Lord John, \"but it\r\nseems to me the earth will be 'To let, empty,' after this.  When once our\r\nhuman crowd is wiped off it, how will it ever get on again?\"",
    "\"The world was empty before,\" Challenger answered gravely.  \"Under laws\r\nwhich in their inception are beyond and above us, it became #VBN#.  Why\r\nmay the same process not happen again?\"",
    "\"My dear Challenger, you can't mean that?\"",
    "\"I am not in the habit, Professor Summerlee, of saying things which I do\r\nnot mean.  The observation is trivial.\"  Out went the beard and down came\r\nthe eyelids.",
    "\"Well, you lived an obstinate #NN#, and you mean to die one,\" said\r\nSummerlee sourly.",
    "\"And you, sir, have lived an unimaginative #NN# and never can\r\nhope now to emerge from it.\"",
    "\"Your worst #NNS# will never accuse you of #VBG# imagination,\"\r\nSummerlee #VBD#.",
    "\"Upon my word!\" said Lord John.  \"It would be like you if you used up our\r\nlast gasp of oxygen in abusing each other.  What can it matter whether\r\nfolk come back or not?  It surely won't be in our time.\"",
    "\"In that remark, sir, you #VB# your own very pronounced limitations,\"\r\nsaid Challenger severely.  \"The true scientific mind is not to be tied\r\ndown by its own conditions of time and space.  It #VBZ# itself an\r\n#NN# #VBN# upon the border line of present, which separates the\r\ninfinite past from the infinite future.  From this sure post it makes its\r\n#NNS# even to the beginning and to the end of all things.  As to death,\r\nthe scientific mind #VBZ# at its post working in normal and #NN#\r\nfashion to the end.  It #NN# so petty a thing as its own physical\r\n#NN# as completely as it does all other limitations upon the plane\r\nof matter.  Am I right, Professor Summerlee?\"",
    "Summerlee grumbled an #JJ# assent.",
    "\"With certain #NNS#, I agree,\" said he.",
    "\"The ideal scientific mind,\" continued #NN#\"I put it in the third\r\nperson rather than appear to be too #NN# ideal scientific\r\nmind should be capable of thinking out a point of abstract knowledge in\r\nthe interval between its owner falling from a balloon and reaching the\r\nearth.  #NNS# of this strong #NN# are needed to form the conquerors of\r\nnature and the #NN# of truth.\"",
    "\"It strikes me nature's on top this time,\" said Lord John, looking out of\r\nthe window.  \"I've read some #NN#' articles about you gentlemen\r\n#NN#' her, but she's gettin' a bit of her own back.\"",
    "\"It is but a temporary setback,\" said Challenger with conviction.  \"A few\r\nmillion years, what are they in the great cycle of time?  The vegetable\r\nworld has, as you can see, survived.  Look at the leaves of that plane\r\ntree.  The birds are dead, but the plant flourishes.  From this vegetable\r\nlife in #NN# and in marsh will come, in time, the tiny crawling\r\n#JJ# #NNS# which are the #NNS# of that great #NN# of life in\r\nwhich for the instant we five have the extraordinary duty of serving as\r\nrear guard.  Once the lowest form of life has established itself, the\r\nfinal advent of man is as certain as the growth of the oak from the\r\n#NN#.  The old circle will #VBG# round once more.\"",
    "\"But the poison?\" I asked.  \"Will that not #NN# life in the bud?\"",
    "\"The poison may be a mere stratum or #NN# in the #NN# mephitic Gulf\r\n#NNP# across that mighty ocean in which we float.  Or tolerance may be\r\nestablished and life #VB# itself to a new condition.  The mere\r\nfact that with a comparatively small #NN# of our blood we can\r\nhold out against it is surely a proof in itself that no very great change\r\nwould be needed to enable animal life to endure it.\"",
    "The smoking house beyond the trees had burst into #NNS#.  We could see\r\nthe high tongues of fire shooting up into the air.",
    "\"It's pretty awful,\" muttered Lord John, more impressed than I had ever\r\nseen him.",
    "\"Well, after all, what does it matter?\" I remarked.  \"The world is dead.\r\n#NN# is surely the best #JJ#.\"",
    "\"It would #VB# us up if this house went ablaze.\"",
    "\"I foresaw the danger,\" said Challenger, \"and asked my wife to guard\r\nagainst it.\"",
    "\"Everything is quite safe, dear.  But my head begins to #NN# again.\r\nWhat a dreadful atmosphere!\"",
    "\"We must change it,\" said Challenger.  He bent over his cylinder of\r\noxygen.",
    "\"It's nearly empty,\" said he.  \"It has lasted us some three and a half\r\nhours.  It is now close on eight o'clock.  We shall get through the night\r\n#RB#.  I should expect the end about nine o'clock to-morrow\r\nmorning.  We shall see one #NN#, which shall be all our own.\"",
    "He turned on his second tube and opened for half a minute the fanlight\r\nover the door.  Then as the air became #RB# better, but our own\r\nsymptoms more acute, he closed it once again.",
    "\"By the way,\" said he, \"man does not live upon oxygen alone.  It's dinner\r\ntime and over.  I assure you, gentlemen, that when I invited you to my\r\nhome and to what I had hoped would be an interesting reunion, I had\r\nintended that my kitchen should justify itself.  However, we must do what\r\nwe can.  I am sure that you will agree with me that it would be folly to\r\n#VBP# our air too rapidly by lighting an #NN#.  I have some small\r\n#NN# of cold #NNS#, #NN#, and #NNS# which, with a couple of\r\nbottles of claret, may serve our turn.  Thank you, my #NN# as ever\r\nyou are the queen of #NNS#.\"",
    "It was indeed wonderful how, with the #NN# and sense of #NN#\r\nof the British housekeeper, the lady had within a few minutes adorned the\r\ncentral table with a snow-white cloth, laid the #NNS# upon it, and set\r\nforth the simple meal with all the elegance of civilization, including an\r\nelectric torch lamp in the centre.  Wonderful also was it to find that\r\nour #NNS# were #JJ#.",
    "\"It is the measure of our emotion,\" said Challenger with that air of\r\ncondescension with which he brought his scientific mind to the\r\nexplanation of humble facts.  \"We have gone through a great crisis.  That\r\nmeans molecular disturbance.  That in turn means the need for #NN#.\r\nGreat sorrow or great joy should bring intense #NN# #NN#\r\nfrom food, as our novelists will have it.\"",
    "\"That's why the country folk have great #NNS# at #NNS#,\" I #VBN#.",
    "\"Exactly.  Our young friend has hit upon an excellent illustration.  Let\r\nme give you another #NN# of tongue.\"",
    "\"The same with savages,\" said Lord John, cutting away at the beef.  \"I've\r\nseen them #NN#' a chief up the #NN# River, and they ate a #NN# that\r\nmust have weighed as much as a tribe.  There are some of them down New\r\n#NNP# way that eat the #VBN# himself, just by way of a last tidy\r\nup.  Well, of all the #JJ# feasts on this earth, I suppose the one we\r\nare takin' is the #JJS#.\"",
    "\"The strange thing is,\" said Mrs. Challenger, \"that I find it impossible\r\nto feel grief for those who are gone.  There are my father and mother at\r\n#NNP#.  I know that they are dead, and yet in this tremendous universal\r\ntragedy I can feel no sharp sorrow for any individuals, even for them.\"",
    "\"And my old mother in her cottage in Ireland,\" said I.  \"I can see her in\r\nmy mind's eye, with her shawl and her #NN# cap, lying back with closed\r\neyes in the old #JJ# chair near the window, her glasses and her\r\nbook beside her.  Why should I #VB# her?  She has passed and I am\r\npassing, and I may be nearer her in some other life than England is to\r\nIreland.  Yet I #NN# to think that that dear body is no more.\"",
    "\"As to the body,\" remarked Challenger, \"we do not mourn over the #NNS#\r\nof our nails nor the cut locks of our hair, though they were once part of\r\nourselves.  Neither does a #VBN# man yearn #RB# over his\r\nmissing member.  The physical body has rather been a source of pain and\r\nfatigue to us.  It is the constant index of our limitations.  Why then\r\nshould we #VB# about its detachment from our #JJ# selves?\"",
    "\"If they can indeed be detached,\" Summerlee grumbled.  \"But, anyhow,\r\nuniversal death is dreadful.\"",
    "\"As I have already explained,\" said Challenger, \"a universal death must\r\nin its nature be far less terrible than a isolated one.\"",
    "\"Same in a battle,\" remarked Lord John.  \"If you saw a single man lying\r\non that floor with his chest knocked in and a hole in his face it would\r\nturn you sick.  But I've seen ten thousand on their backs in the #NN#,\r\nand it gave me no such #NN#', for when you are makin' history the life\r\nof any man is too small a thing to worry over.  When a thousand million\r\npass over together, same as happened to-day, you can't pick your own\r\n#NN#'#NN# out of the crowd.\"",
    "\"I wish it were well over with us,\" said the lady wistfully.  \"Oh,\r\nGeorge, I am so frightened.\"",
    "\"You'll be the #JJS# of us all, little lady, when the time comes.  I've\r\nbeen a #NN# old husband to you, dear, but you'll just bear in mind\r\nthat G.  E.  C.  is as he was made and couldn't help himself.  After all,\r\nyou wouldn't have had anyone else?\"",
    "\"No one in the whole wide world, dear,\" said she, and put her arms round\r\nhis bull neck.  We three walked to the window and stood amazed at the\r\nsight which met our eyes.",
    "#NN# had fallen and the dead world was #VBN# in gloom.  But right\r\nacross the southern horizon was one long vivid scarlet streak, #VBG# and\r\n#VBG# in vivid #NNS# of life, #VBG# suddenly to a crimson #NN# and\r\nthen dying down to a glowing line of fire.",
    "\"Lewes is ablaze!\"",
    "\"No, it is Brighton which is burning,\" said Challenger, stepping across\r\nto join us.  \"You can see the curved back of the downs against the glow.\r\nThat fire is miles on the farther side of it.  The whole town must be\r\n#JJ#.\"",
    "There were several red #VBZ# at different points, and the pile of\r\n#NN# upon the railway line was still #VBG# #RB#, but they all\r\n#VBN# mere #NNS# of light compared to that monstrous #NN#\r\nthrobbing beyond the hills.  What copy it would have made for the\r\nGazette!  Had ever a journalist such an opening and so little chance of\r\nusing it--the scoop of #VBZ#, and no one to appreciate it?  And then,\r\nsuddenly, the old instinct of recording came over me.  If these men of\r\nscience could be so true to their life's work to the very end, why should\r\nnot I, in my humble way, be as constant?  No human eye might ever rest\r\nupon what I had done.  But the long night had to be passed somehow, and\r\nfor me at least, sleep seemed to be out of the question.  My notes would\r\nhelp to pass the weary hours and to #VB# my thoughts.  Thus it is that\r\nnow I have before me the notebook with its scribbled pages, written\r\n#RB# upon my knee in the dim, waning light of our one electric\r\ntorch.  Had I the #JJ# touch, they might have been worthy of the\r\noccasion. As it is, they may still serve to bring to other minds the\r\nlong-drawn emotions and #NNS# of that awful night.",
    "Chapter IV",
    "A DIARY OF THE DYING",
    "How strange the words look scribbled at the top of the empty page of my\r\nbook!  How stranger still that it is I, Edward Malone, who have written\r\n#NN# who started only some twelve hours ago from my rooms in Streatham\r\nwithout one thought of the #NNS# which the day was to bring forth!  I\r\nlook back at the chain of incidents, my interview with McArdle,\r\nChallenger's first note of alarm in the Times, the absurd journey in the\r\ntrain, the pleasant luncheon, the catastrophe, and now it has come to\r\n#NN# we linger alone upon an empty planet, and so sure is our fate\r\nthat I can regard these lines, written from mechanical professional habit\r\nand never to be seen by human eyes, as the words of one who is already\r\ndead, so closely does he stand to the shadowed borderland over which all\r\noutside this one little circle of friends have already gone.  I feel how\r\nwise and true were the words of Challenger when he said that the real\r\ntragedy would be if we were left behind when all that is noble and good\r\nand beautiful had passed.  But of that there can surely be no danger.\r\nAlready our second tube of oxygen is drawing to an end.  We can count the\r\npoor #NNS# of our lives almost to a minute.",
    "We have just been treated to a lecture, a good quarter of an hour long,\r\nfrom Challenger, who was so excited that he roared and bellowed as if he\r\nwere addressing his old rows of scientific #NN# in the Queen's Hall.\r\nHe had certainly a strange audience to harangue:  his wife perfectly\r\n#NN# and absolutely ignorant of his meaning, Summerlee seated in\r\nthe shadow, querulous and critical but interested, Lord John lounging in\r\na corner somewhat bored by the whole proceeding, and myself beside the\r\nwindow watching the scene with a kind of detached attention, as if it\r\nwere all a dream or something in which I had no personal interest\r\nwhatever.  Challenger sat at the centre table with the electric light\r\n#JJ# the #NN# under the microscope which he had brought from his\r\ndressing room.  The small vivid circle of white light from the mirror\r\nleft half of his rugged, bearded face in brilliant radiance and half in\r\ndeepest shadow.  He had, it seems, been working of late upon the lowest\r\nforms of life, and what excited him at the present moment was that in the\r\nmicroscopic slide made up the day before he found the #NN# to be still\r\nalive.",
    "\"You can see it for yourselves,\" he kept repeating in great excitement.\r\n\"Summerlee, will you step across and satisfy yourself upon the point?\r\nMalone, will you kindly verify what I say?  The little #VBN#\r\nthings in the centre are #NNS# and may be disregarded since they are\r\nprobably vegetable rather than animal.  But the right-hand side you will\r\nsee an undoubted amoeba, moving #RB# across the field.  The upper\r\n#NN# is the fine #NN#.  Look at it for yourselves.\"",
    "Summerlee did so and #VBD#.  So did I and perceived a little\r\ncreature which looked as if it were made of ground glass #VBG# in a\r\n#JJ# way across the lighted circle.  Lord John was prepared to take him\r\non trust.",
    "\"I'm not #NN#' my head whether he's alive or dead,\" said he.  \"We\r\ndon't so much as know each other by sight, so why should I take it to\r\nheart?  I don't suppose he's #VBG#' himself over the state of #NN#\r\nhealth.\"",
    "I laughed at this, and Challenger looked in my direction with his #JJS#\r\nand most supercilious stare.  It was a most #VBG# experience.",
    "\"The flippancy of the half-educated is more #JJ# to science than\r\nthe #NN# of the ignorant,\" said he.  \"If Lord John Roxton would\r\n#VB#\"",
    "\"My dear George, don't be so #JJ#,\" said his wife, with her hand on\r\nthe black #NN# that #VBD# over the microscope.  \"What can it matter\r\nwhether the amoeba is alive or not?\"",
    "\"It matters a great deal,\" said Challenger #RB#.",
    "\"Well, let's hear about it,\" said Lord John with a #VBN# smile.\r\n\"We may as well talk about that as anything else.  If you think I've been\r\ntoo #NN# with the thing, or hurt its feelin's in any way, I'll\r\napologize.\"",
    "\"For my part,\" remarked Summerlee in his creaky, argumentative voice, \"I\r\ncan't see why you should attach such importance to the creature being\r\nalive.  It is in the same atmosphere as ourselves, so naturally the\r\npoison does not act upon it.  If it were outside of this room it would be\r\ndead, like all other animal life.\"",
    "\"Your remarks, my good Summerlee,\" said Challenger with enormous\r\ncondescension (#UH#, if I could paint that #VBG#, arrogant face in\r\nthe vivid circle of reflection from the microscope mirror!)--\"your\r\nremarks show that you imperfectly appreciate the situation.  This\r\nspecimen was #VBN# yesterday and is #RB# sealed.  None of our\r\noxygen can reach it.  But the ether, of course, has penetrated to it, as\r\nto every other point upon the universe.  Therefore, it has survived the\r\npoison.  Hence, we may argue that every amoeba outside this room, instead\r\nof being dead, as you have #RB# stated, has really survived the\r\ncatastrophe.\"",
    "\"Well, even now I don't feel inclined to #NN# about it,\" said Lord\r\nJohn.  \"What does it matter?\"",
    "\"It just matters this, that the world is a living instead of a dead one.\r\nIf you had the scientific imagination, you would #VB# your mind forward\r\nfrom this one fact, and you would see some few millions of years #NN#\r\nmere passing moment in the enormous #NN# of the #NN# whole world\r\n#VBG# once more with the animal and human life which will spring from\r\nthis tiny root.  You have seen a #NN# fire where the flames have swept\r\nevery trace of grass or plant from the surface of the earth and left only\r\na blackened waste.  You would think that it must be forever desert.  Yet\r\nthe roots of growth have been left behind, and when you pass the place a\r\nfew years hence you can no longer tell where the black scars used to be.\r\nHere in this tiny creature are the roots of growth of the animal world,\r\nand by its #JJ# development, and evolution, it will surely in time\r\nremove every trace of this incomparable crisis in which we are now\r\ninvolved.\"",
    "\"Dooced interestin'!\" said Lord John, lounging across and looking through\r\nthe microscope.  \"#JJ# little chap to hang number one among the family\r\n#NNS#.  Got a fine big #NN# on him!\"",
    "\"The dark object is his #NNS#,\" said Challenger with the air of a nurse\r\nteaching letters to a baby.",
    "\"Well, we #NN#'t feel lonely,\" said Lord John laughing.  \"There's\r\nsomebody livin' besides us on the earth.\"",
    "\"You seem to take it for #VBN#, Challenger,\" said Summerlee, \"that the\r\nobject for which this world was #VBN# was that it should produce and\r\nsustain human life.\"",
    "\"Well, sir, and what object do you suggest?\" asked Challenger, bristling\r\nat the least #NN# of #NN#.",
    "\"Sometimes I think that it is only the monstrous conceit of mankind which\r\nmakes him think that all this stage was erected for him to #NN# upon.\"",
    "\"We cannot be dogmatic about it, but at least without what you have\r\nventured to call monstrous conceit we can surely say that we are the\r\nhighest thing in nature.\"",
    "\"The highest of which we have #NN#.\"",
    "\"That, sir, goes without saying.\"",
    "\"Think of all the millions and possibly #NNS# of years that the earth\r\nswung empty through #NN#, if not empty, at least without a sign or\r\nthought of the human race.  Think of it, washed by the rain and #JJ#\r\nby the sun and swept by the wind for those #JJ# ages.  Man only\r\ncame into being yesterday so far as #JJ# times goes.  Why, then,\r\nshould it be taken for granted that all this stupendous preparation was\r\nfor his benefit?\"",
    "\"For whose #NN# for what?\"",
    "Summerlee shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\"How can we tell?  For some reason altogether beyond our #NN#\r\nman may have been a mere accident, a #NN# evolved in the process.\r\nIt is as if the #NN# upon the surface of the ocean imagined that the\r\nocean was created in order to produce and sustain it, or a mouse in a\r\n#JJ# thought that the building was its own proper #VBN#\r\nresidence.\"",
    "I have jotted down the very words of their argument, but now it\r\n#VBZ# into a mere noisy #NN# with much #NN# scientific\r\n#NN# upon each side.  It is no doubt a privilege to hear two such\r\nbrains discuss the highest questions; but as they are in perpetual\r\ndisagreement, plain folk like Lord John and I get little that is positive\r\nfrom the exhibition.  They neutralize each other and we are left as they\r\nfound us.  Now the #NN# has ceased, and Summerlee is coiled up in his\r\nchair, while Challenger, still #VBG# the #NNS# of his microscope, is\r\nkeeping up a continual low, deep, #JJ# growl like the sea after a\r\nstorm.  Lord John comes over to me, and we look out together into the\r\nnight.",
    "There is a pale new #NN# last moon that human eyes will ever rest\r\n#NN# the stars are most brilliant.  Even in the clear plateau air of\r\nSouth America I have never seen them #JJR#.  Possibly this etheric\r\nchange has some effect upon light.  The funeral #NN# of Brighton is still\r\nblazing, and there is a very distant patch of scarlet in the western sky,\r\nwhich may mean trouble at #NNP# or #NN#, possibly even at\r\nPortsmouth.  I sit and #NN# and make an occasional note.  There is a\r\nsweet melancholy in the air.  #NNP# and beauty and #NN# and #NNS#\r\nthis to be the end of it all?  The starlit earth looks a dreamland of\r\ngentle peace.  Who would imagine it as the terrible #NN# strewn with\r\nthe bodies of the human race?  Suddenly, I find myself laughing.",
    "\"Halloa, young fellah!\" says Lord John, staring at me in surprise.  \"We\r\ncould do with a joke in these hard times.  What was it, then?\"",
    "\"I was thinking of all the great unsolved questions,\" I answer, \"the\r\nquestions that we spent so much labor and thought over.  Think of\r\n#NN# competition, for #NN# the Persian Gulf that my old\r\nchief was so keen about.  Whoever would have guessed, when we #VBD# and\r\n#VBD# so, how they were to be eventually solved?\"",
    "We fall into silence again.  I fancy that each of us is thinking of\r\nfriends that have gone before.  Mrs. Challenger is sobbing quietly, and\r\nher husband is whispering to her.  My mind turns to all the most unlikely\r\npeople, and I see each of them lying white and rigid as poor Austin does\r\nin the yard.  There is McArdle, for example, I know exactly where he is,\r\nwith his face upon his writing desk and his hand on his own telephone,\r\njust as I heard him fall.  Beaumont, the editor, #NN# suppose he is\r\nlying upon the #VBN# #NNP# carpet which adorned his sanctum.  And\r\nthe fellows in the reporters' #NN# and Murray and #NNP#.  They\r\nhad certainly died hard at work on their job, with note-books full of\r\nvivid impressions and strange happenings in their hands.  I could just\r\nimagine how this one would have been packed off to the doctors, and that\r\nother to Westminster, and yet a third to St.  #NNP#'s.  What glorious rows\r\nof #NNS# they must have seen as a last vision beautiful, never\r\ndestined to #VB# in #NN#'s ink!  I could see Macdona among the\r\n#NN#\"Hope in Harley Street\"#NN# had always a weakness for\r\n#NN#.  \"#NNP# with Mr. #NN# Wilson.\" \"#NNP# #NNP# says\r\n'Never despair!'\" \"Our Special #NN# found the #JJ# scientist\r\nseated upon the roof, whither he had #VBD# to avoid the crowd of\r\nterrified #NNS# who had stormed his dwelling.  With a manner which\r\nplainly showed his appreciation of the immense gravity of the occasion,\r\nthe #VBN# #NN# refused to admit that every avenue of hope had\r\nbeen closed.\"  That's how Mac would start.  Then there was Bond; he would\r\nprobably do St.  Paul's.  He #VBD# his own literary touch.  My word,\r\nwhat a #NN# for him!  \"Standing in the little gallery under the dome and\r\nlooking down upon that packed mass of despairing humanity, #VBG# at\r\nthis last instant before a #NNP# which they had so persistently #VBN#,\r\nthere rose to my ears from the swaying crowd such a low #VB# of #NN#\r\nand terror, such a #VBG# cry for help to the Unknown, #NN#\" and\r\nso forth.",
    "Yes, it would be a great end for a reporter, though, like myself, he\r\nwould die with the treasures still #JJ#.  What would #VB# not give,\r\npoor chap, to see \"J.  H.  B.\" at the foot of a column like that?",
    "But what #NN# I am writing!  It is just an attempt to pass the weary\r\ntime.  Mrs. Challenger has gone to the inner dressing-room, and the\r\nProfessor says that she is asleep.  He is making notes and #VBG#\r\nbooks at the central table, as calmly as if years of placid work lay\r\nbefore him.  He #VBZ# with a very noisy #NN# pen which seems to be\r\n#VBG# #NN# at all who disagree with him.",
    "Summerlee has dropped off in his chair and gives from time to time a\r\npeculiarly #VBG# snore.  Lord John lies back with his hands in his\r\npockets and his eyes closed.  How people can sleep under such conditions\r\nis more than I can imagine.",
    "#NN# a.m.  I have just #VBN# with a start.  It was five minutes\r\npast eleven when I made my last entry.  I remember winding up my watch\r\nand noting the time.  So I have wasted some five hours of the little span\r\nstill left to us.  Who would have believed it possible?  But I feel very\r\nmuch #JJR#, and ready for my #NN# try to persuade myself that I am.\r\nAnd yet, the fitter a man is, and the higher his tide of life, the more\r\nmust he shrink from death.  How wise and how merciful is that provision\r\nof nature by which his earthly anchor is usually loosened by many little\r\n#JJ# #NNS#, until his #NN# has drifted out of its\r\n#JJ# earthly #NN# into the great sea beyond!",
    "Mrs. Challenger is still in the dressing room.  Challenger has fallen\r\nasleep in his chair.  What a picture!  His enormous frame #VBZ# back, his\r\nhuge, hairy hands are clasped across his waistcoat, and his head is so\r\ntilted that I can see nothing above his collar save a tangled bristle of\r\nluxuriant beard.  He #VBZ# with the #NN# of his own #VBG#.\r\nSummerlee #VBZ# his occasional high #NN# to Challenger's sonorous bass.\r\nLord John is sleeping also, his long body #VBD# up sideways in a\r\nbasket-chair.  The first cold light of dawn is just stealing into the\r\nroom, and everything is grey and #JJ#.",
    "I look out at the #NN# #JJ# sunrise which will #NN# upon an\r\n#VBN# world.  The human race is gone, extinguished in a day, but the\r\nplanets swing round and the #NNS# rise or fall, and the wind #NNS#,\r\nand all nature goes her way, down, as it would seem, to the very amoeba,\r\nwith never a sign that he who #VBN# himself the #NN# of creation had\r\never blessed or cursed the universe with his presence.  Down in the yard\r\nlies Austin with sprawling limbs, his face glimmering white in the dawn,\r\nand the hose nozzle still projecting from his dead hand.  The whole of\r\nhuman kind is #VBN# in that one #NNS# and #NN#\r\nfigure, lying so helpless beside the machine which it used to control.",
    "Here end the notes which I made at the time.  #NN# events were\r\ntoo swift and too #JJ# to allow me to write, but they are too clearly\r\noutlined in my memory that any detail could escape me.",
    "Some #NN# in my throat made me look at the oxygen cylinders, and I\r\nwas startled at what I saw.  The sands of our lives were running very\r\nlow.  At some period in the night Challenger had #VBD# the tube from\r\nthe third to the fourth cylinder.  Now it was clear that this also was\r\nnearly exhausted.  That horrible feeling of constriction was closing in\r\nupon me.  I ran across and, #VBG# the nozzle, I changed it to our\r\nlast supply.  Even as I did so my conscience #VBN# me, for I felt that\r\nperhaps if I had held my hand all of them might have passed in their\r\nsleep.  The thought was #VBN#, however, by the voice of the lady from\r\nthe inner room crying:--",
    "\"George, George, I am #VBG#!\"",
    "\"It is all right, Mrs. Challenger,\" I answered as the others started to\r\ntheir feet.  \"I have just turned on a fresh supply.\"",
    "Even at such a moment I could not help smiling at Challenger, who with a\r\ngreat hairy fist in each eye was like a huge, bearded baby, new wakened\r\nout of sleep.  Summerlee was #VBG# like a man with the #NN#, human\r\nfears, as he realized his position, rising for an instant above the\r\n#NN# of the man of science.  Lord John, however, was as #JJ# and\r\nalert as if he had just been roused on a hunting morning.",
    "\"#RB# and #RB#,\" said he, glancing at the tube.  \"Say, young fellah,\r\ndon't tell me you've been #NN#' up your impressions in that paper on\r\nyour knee.\"",
    "\"Just a few notes to pass the time.\"",
    "\"Well, I don't believe anyone but an Irishman would have done that.  I\r\nexpect you'll have to wait till little brother amoeba gets grown up\r\nbefore you'll find a reader.  He don't seem to take much stock of things\r\njust at present.  Well, Herr Professor, what are the prospects?\"",
    "Challenger was looking out at the great #VBZ# of morning mist which lay\r\nover the landscape.  Here and there the wooded hills rose like conical\r\n#NNS# out of this #RB# sea.",
    "\"It might be a winding sheet,\" said Mrs. Challenger, who had entered in\r\nher dressing-gown.  \"There's that song of yours, George, 'Ring out the\r\nold, ring in the new.' It was #JJ#.  But you are shivering, my poor\r\ndear friends.  I have been warm under a coverlet all night, and you cold\r\nin your chairs.  But I'll soon set you right.\"",
    "The brave little creature hurried away, and presently we heard the\r\n#JJ# of a kettle.  She was back soon with five steaming cups of cocoa\r\nupon a tray.",
    "\"#VB# these,\" said she.  \"You will feel so much better.\"",
    "And we did.  Summerlee asked if he might light his pipe, and we all had\r\ncigarettes.  It steadied our nerves, I think, but it was a mistake, for\r\nit made a dreadful atmosphere in that stuffy room.  Challenger had to\r\nopen the #NN#.",
    "\"How long, Challenger?\" asked Lord John.",
    "\"Possibly three hours,\" he answered with a shrug.",
    "\"I used to be frightened,\" said his wife.  \"But the nearer I get to it,\r\nthe easier it seems.  Don't you think we ought to pray, George?\"",
    "\"You will pray, dear, if you wish,\" the big man answered, very gently.\r\n\"We all have our own ways of #VBG#.  Mine is a complete acquiescence in\r\nwhatever fate may send #NN# cheerful acquiescence.  The highest #NN#\r\nand the highest science seem to unite on that.\"",
    "\"I cannot #RB# describe my mental attitude as acquiescence and far\r\nless cheerful acquiescence,\" grumbled Summerlee over his pipe.  \"I submit\r\nbecause I have to.  I confess that I should have liked another year of\r\nlife to finish my classification of the chalk fossils.\"",
    "\"Your #JJ# work is a small thing,\" said Challenger #RB#, \"when\r\nweighed against the fact that my own #NN# #NN#, 'The #NN# of Life,'\r\nis still in the first #NNS#.

    "\"I expect we've all left some loose ends #NN#' out,\" said Lord John.\r\n\"What are yours, young fellah?\"",
    "\"I was working at a book of #NNS#,\" I answered.",
    "\"Well, the world has escaped that, anyhow,\" said Lord John.  \"There's\r\nalways compensation somewhere if you grope around.\"",
    "\"What about you?\" I asked.",
    "\"Well, it just so happens that I was #VBD# up and ready.  I'd promised\r\nMerivale to go to #NNP# for a #NN# #NN# in the spring.  But it's hard\r\non you, Mrs. Challenger, when you have just built up this pretty home.\"",
    "\"Where George is, there is my home.  But, oh, what would I not give for\r\none last walk together in the fresh morning air upon those beautiful\r\ndowns!\"",
    "Our hearts #VBN# her words.  The sun had burst through the gauzy\r\nmists which #VBN# it, and the whole broad #NN# was washed in golden\r\nlight.  #VBG# in our dark and poisonous atmosphere that glorious,\r\nclean, #JJ# countryside seemed a very dream of beauty.  Mrs.\r\nChallenger held her hand stretched out to it in her longing.  We drew up\r\nchairs and sat in a semicircle in the window.  The atmosphere was already\r\nvery close.  It seemed to me that the shadows of death were drawing in\r\nupon #NN# last of our race.  It was like an invisible curtain closing\r\ndown upon every side.",
    "\"That cylinder is not #NN#' too well,\" said Lord John with a long gasp\r\nfor breath.",
    "\"The amount contained is #JJ#,\" said Challenger, \"depending upon the\r\npressure and care with which it has been #JJ#.  I am inclined to agree\r\nwith you, Roxton, that this one is defective.\"",
    "\"So we are to be #VBN# out of the last hour of our lives,\" Summerlee\r\nremarked bitterly.  \"An excellent final illustration of the #JJ# age in\r\nwhich we have lived.  Well, Challenger, now is your time if you wish to\r\nstudy the #JJ# phenomena of physical dissolution.\"",
    "\"Sit on the stool at my knee and give me your hand,\" said Challenger to\r\nhis wife.  \"I think, my friends, that a further delay in this\r\ninsufferable atmosphere is hardly #JJ#.  You would not desire it,\r\ndear, would you?\"",
    "His wife gave a little groan and sank her face against his leg.",
    "\"I've seen the folk #NN#' in the #NNP# in winter,\" said Lord John.\r\n\"When the rest are in, you see one or two #NN#' on the bank, #NN#'\r\nthe others that have taken the plunge.  It's the last that have the worst\r\nof it.  I'm all for a #NN# and have done with it.\"",
    "\"You would open the window and face the ether?\"",
    "\"#NNP# be poisoned than #VBD#.\"",
    "Summerlee nodded his #JJ# acquiescence and held out his thin hand to\r\nChallenger.",

    "\"Good-by, young fellah!\" said Lord John.  \"The window's plastered up.\r\nYou can't open it.\"",
    "Challenger stooped and raised his wife, pressing her to his breast, while\r\nshe threw her arms round his neck.",
    "\"Give me that field-glass, Malone,\" said he gravely.",
    "I handed it to him.",
    "\"Into the hands of the Power that made us we #VB# ourselves again!\" he\r\nshouted in his voice of thunder, and at the words he hurled the\r\nfield-glass through the window.",
    "#JJ# in our flushed faces, before the last tinkle of falling fragments\r\nhad died away, there came the #JJ# breath of the wind, blowing\r\nstrong and sweet.",

    "Chapter V",
    "THE DEAD WORLD",
    "I remember that we all sat gasping in our chairs, with that sweet, wet\r\n#NN# breeze, fresh from the sea, flapping the #NN# curtains\r\nand cooling our flushed faces.  I wonder how long we sat!  None of us\r\nafterwards could agree at all on that point.  We were bewildered,\r\nstunned, #JJ#.  We had all #VBN# our courage for death, but\r\nthis fearful and sudden new #NN# we must continue to live after we\r\nhad survived the race to which we #NN# us with the shock of a\r\nphysical blow and left us prostrate.  Then gradually the suspended\r\nmechanism began to move once more; the #NNS# of memory worked; ideas\r\n#VBN# themselves together in our minds.  We saw, with vivid, merciless\r\nclearness, the relations between the past, the present, and the\r\n#NN# lives that we had led and the lives which we would have to\r\nlive.  Our eyes turned in silent horror upon those of our companions and\r\nfound the same answering look in theirs.  Instead of the joy which men\r\nmight have been expected to feel who had so #RB# escaped an imminent\r\ndeath, a terrible wave of #JJS# depression submerged us.  Everything on\r\nearth that we loved had been washed away into the great, infinite,\r\nunknown ocean, and here were we marooned upon this desert island of a\r\nworld, without companions, hopes, or #NNS#.  A few years' #VBG#\r\nlike #NNS# among the #NNS# of the human race and then our belated and\r\nlonely end would come.",
    "\"It's dreadful, George, dreadful!\" the lady cried in an agony of sobs.\r\n\"If we had only passed with the others!  Oh, why did you save us?  I feel\r\nas if it is we that are dead and everyone else alive.\"",
    "Challenger's great eyebrows were drawn down in concentrated thought,\r\nwhile his huge, hairy paw closed upon the #VBN# hand of his wife.\r\nI had observed that she always held out her arms to him in trouble as a\r\nchild would to its mother.",
    "\"Without being a #NN# to the point of #NN#,\" said he, \"I\r\nhave always found that the highest wisdom lies in an acquiescence with\r\nthe actual.\"  He spoke slowly, and there was a vibration of feeling in\r\nhis sonorous voice.",
    "\"I do _not_ acquiesce,\" said Summerlee firmly.",
    "\"I don't see that it matters a row of #NNS# whether you acquiesce or\r\nwhether you don't,\" remarked Lord John.  \"You've got to take it, whether\r\nyou take it #VBG#' or take it #NN#' down, so what's the odds whether\r\nyou acquiesce or not?",
    "\"I can't remember that anyone asked our permission before the thing\r\nbegan, and nobody's likely to ask it now.  So what difference can it make\r\nwhat we may think of it?\"",
    "\"It is just all the difference between #NN# and misery,\" said\r\nChallenger with an #JJ# face, still patting his wife's hand.  \"You\r\ncan #VB# with the tide and have peace in mind and soul, or you can thrust\r\nagainst it and be bruised and weary.  This business is beyond us, so let\r\nus accept it as it stands and say no more.\"",
    "\"But what in the world are we to do with our lives?\" I asked, #JJ#\r\nin desperation to the blue, empty heaven.",
    "\"What am I to do, for example?  There are no #NNS#, so there's an\r\nend of my #NN#.\"",
    "\"And there's nothin' left to shoot, and no more soldierin', so there's an\r\nend of mine,\" said Lord John.",
    "\"And there are no students, so there's an end of mine,\" cried Summerlee.",
    "\"But I have my husband and my house, so I can thank heaven that there is\r\nno end of mine,\" said the lady.",
    "\"Nor is there an end of mine,\" remarked Challenger, \"for science is not\r\ndead, and this catastrophe in itself will offer us many most absorbing\r\nproblems for investigation.\"",
    "He had now flung open the windows and we were gazing out upon the silent\r\nand motionless landscape.",
    "\"Let me consider,\" he continued.  \"It was about three, or a little after,\r\nyesterday afternoon that the world finally entered the poison belt to the\r\nextent of being completely submerged.  It is now nine o'clock.  The\r\nquestion is, at what hour did we pass out from it?\"",
    "\"The air was very bad at #NN#,\" said I.",
    "\"Later than that,\" said Mrs. Challenger.  \"As late as eight o'clock I\r\ndistinctly felt the same choking at my throat which came at the outset.\"",
    "\"Then we shall say that it passed just after eight o'clock.  For\r\n#NN# hours the world has been #VBN# in the poisonous ether.  For\r\nthat length of time the Great Gardener has sterilized the human #NN#\r\nwhich had grown over the surface of His fruit.  Is it possible that the\r\nwork is #RB# #NN# others may have survived besides\r\nourselves?\"",
    "\"That's what I was #NN#',\" said Lord John.  \"Why should we be the only\r\n#NNS# on the beach?\"",
    "\"It is absurd to suppose that anyone besides ourselves can possibly have\r\nsurvived,\" said Summerlee with conviction.  \"#VB# that the poison was\r\nso #JJ# that even a man who is as strong as an ox and has not a nerve\r\nin his body, like Malone here, could hardly get up the stairs before he\r\nfell unconscious.  Is it likely that anyone could stand seventeen minutes\r\nof it, far less hours?\"",
    "\"Unless someone saw it coming and made preparation, same as old friend\r\nChallenger did.\"",
    "\"That, I think, is hardly probable,\" said Challenger, projecting his\r\nbeard and sinking his eyelids.  \"The combination of observation,\r\n#NN#, and #JJ# imagination which enabled me to foresee the\r\ndanger is what one can hardly expect twice in the same generation.\"",
    "\"Then your conclusion is that everyone is certainly dead?\"",
    "\"There can be little doubt of that.  We have to remember, however, that\r\nthe poison worked from below upwards and would possibly be less virulent\r\nin the higher strata of the atmosphere.  It is strange, indeed, that it\r\nshould be so; but it presents one of those features which will afford us\r\nin the future a fascinating field for study.  One could imagine,\r\ntherefore, that if one had to search for survivors one would turn one's\r\neyes with best hopes of success to some #JJ# village or some Alpine\r\nfarm, many thousands of feet above the sea level.\"",
    "\"Well, #VBG#' that there are no #NNS# and no steamers you might\r\nas well talk about survivors in the moon,\" said Lord John.  \"But what I'm\r\n#VBG#' myself is whether it's really over or whether it's only #NN#.\"",
    "Summerlee craned his neck to look round the horizon.  \"It seems clear and\r\nfine,\" said he in a very dubious voice; \"but so it did yesterday.  I am\r\nby no means assured that it is all over.\"",
    "Challenger shrugged his shoulders.",
    "\"We must come back once more to our #NN#,\" said he.  \"If the world\r\nhas undergone this experience before, which is not outside the range of\r\npossibility, it was certainly a very long time ago.  Therefore, we may\r\n#RB# hope that it will be very long before it occurs again.\"",
    "\"That's all very well,\" said Lord John, \"but if you get an earthquake\r\nshock you are mighty likely to have a second one right on the top of it.\r\nI think we'd be wise to stretch our legs and have a breath of air while\r\nwe have the chance.  Since our oxygen is exhausted we may just as well be\r\ncaught outside as in.\"",
    "It was strange the absolute #NN# which had come upon us as a reaction\r\nafter our tremendous emotions of the last twenty-four hours.  It was both\r\nmental and physical, a #VBG# feeling that nothing #VBD# and that\r\neverything was a #NN# and a #NN# #NN#.  Even Challenger\r\nhad succumbed to it, and sat in his chair, with his great head leaning\r\nupon his hands and his thoughts far away, until Lord John and I, #VBG#\r\nhim by each arm, fairly lifted him on to his feet, #VBG# only the\r\nglare and growl of an angry #NN# for our trouble.  However, once we\r\nhad got out of our narrow haven of refuge into the wider atmosphere of\r\n#JJ# life, our normal energy came gradually back to us once more.",
    "But what were we to begin to do in that #NN# of a world?  Could ever\r\nmen have been faced with such a question since the dawn of time?  It is\r\ntrue that our own physical needs, and even our #NNS#, were assured for\r\nthe future.  All the stores of food, all the #NNS# of wine, all the\r\ntreasures of art were ours for the taking.  But what were we to #NN#?\r\nSome few #NNS# appealed to us at once, since they lay ready to our hands.\r\nWe descended into the kitchen and laid the two #NN# upon their\r\n#JJ# #NNS#.  They seemed to have died without suffering, one in the\r\nchair by the fire, the other upon the #NN# floor.  Then we carried in\r\npoor Austin from the yard.  His muscles were set as hard as a board in\r\nthe most exaggerated #NN# #NNS#, while the contraction of the #NNS#\r\nhad drawn his mouth into a hard sardonic #NN#.  This symptom was\r\n#JJ# among all who had died from the poison.  Wherever we went we\r\nwere confronted by those grinning faces, which seemed to mock at our\r\ndreadful position, smiling #RB# and grimly at the ill-fated survivors\r\nof their race.",
    "\"Look here,\" said Lord John, who had paced restlessly about the\r\ndining-room whilst we #VBP# of some food, \"I don't know how you fellows\r\nfeel about it, but for my part, I simply #NN#'#NN# sit here and do nothin'.\"",
    "\"Perhaps,\" Challenger answered, \"you would have the kindness to suggest\r\nwhat you think we ought to do.\"",
    "\"Get a move on us and see all that has happened.\"",
    "\"That is what I should myself propose.\"",
    "\"But not in this little country village.  We can see from the window all\r\nthat this place can #VB# us.\"",
    "\"Where should we go, then?\"",
    "\"To London!\"",
    "\"That's all very well,\" grumbled Summerlee.  \"You may be #JJ# to a\r\n#NN# walk, but I'm not so sure about Challenger, with his stumpy\r\nlegs, and I am perfectly sure about myself.\" Challenger was very much\r\nannoyed.",
    "\"If you could see your way, sir, to #VBG# your remarks to your own\r\nphysical peculiarities, you would find that you had an ample field for\r\ncomment,\" he cried.",
    "\"I had no intention to offend you, my dear Challenger,\" cried our\r\ntactless friend. \"You can't be held responsible for your own physique.\r\nIf nature has given you a short, heavy body you cannot possibly help\r\nhaving stumpy legs.\"",
    "Challenger was too furious to answer.  He could only growl and #VB# and\r\nbristle.  Lord John hastened to intervene before the dispute became more\r\nviolent.",
    "\"You talk of walking.  Why should we walk?\" said he.",
    "\"Do you suggest taking a train?\" asked Challenger, still simmering.",
    "\"What's the matter with the motor-car?  Why should we not go in that?\"",
    "\"I am not an expert,\" said Challenger, pulling at his beard reflectively.\r\n\"At the same time, you are right in supposing that the human intellect in\r\nits higher manifestations should be #RB# flexible to turn itself\r\nto anything.  Your idea is an excellent one, Lord John.  I myself will\r\ndrive you all to London.\"",
    "\"You will do nothing of the kind,\" said Summerlee with decision.",
    "\"No, indeed, George!\" cried his wife.  \"You only tried once, and you\r\nremember how you crashed through the gate of the garage.\"",
    "\"It was a momentary want of concentration,\" said Challenger complacently.\r\n\"You can consider the matter settled.  I will certainly drive you all to\r\nLondon.\"",
    "The situation was relieved by Lord John.",
    "\"What's the car?\" he asked.",
    "\"A #NN# #NN#.\"",
    "\"Why, I've driven one for years,\" said he.  \"By George!\" he added.  \"I\r\nnever thought I'd live to take the whole human race in one #NN#.  There's\r\njust room for five, as I remember it.  Get your things on, and I'll be\r\nready at the door by ten o'clock.\"",
    "Sure enough, at the hour named, the car came #VBG# and #VBG# from\r\nthe yard with Lord John at the wheel.  I took my seat beside him, while\r\nthe lady, a useful little #NN# state, was squeezed in between the two\r\nmen of wrath at the back.  Then Lord John released his brakes, slid his\r\nlever rapidly from first to third, and we #VBD# off upon the strangest\r\ndrive that ever human beings have taken since man first came upon the\r\nearth.",
    "You are to picture the loveliness of nature upon that August day, the\r\n#NN# of the morning air, the golden glare of the summer sunshine,\r\nthe #JJ# sky, the luxuriant green of the Sussex woods, and the deep\r\npurple of #NN# downs.  As you looked round upon the many-coloured\r\nbeauty of the scene all thought of a vast catastrophe would have passed\r\nfrom your mind had it not been for one sinister #NN# solemn,\r\n#VBG# silence.  There is a gentle hum of life which pervades a\r\n#VBN# country, so deep and constant that one #VBZ# to observe\r\nit, as the dweller by the sea #VBZ# all sense of the constant murmur of\r\nthe #NNS#.  The #NN# of birds, the buzz of insects, the far-off #NN#\r\nof voices, the #VBG# of cattle, the distant #VBG# of dogs, roar of\r\ntrains, and rattle of #NN# these form one low, #JJ# note,\r\nstriking #JJ# upon the ear.  We missed it now.  This deadly silence\r\nwas #JJ#.  So solemn was it, so impressive, that the buzz and rattle\r\nof our motor-car seemed an unwarrantable intrusion, an #JJ# disregard\r\nof this #JJ# stillness which lay like a #NN# over and round the ruins\r\nof humanity.  It was this grim hush, and the tall clouds of smoke which\r\nrose here and there over the country-side from smoldering #NNS#,\r\nwhich cast a chill into our hearts as we gazed round at the glorious\r\npanorama of the Weald.",
    "And then there were the dead!  At first those endless groups of drawn and\r\ngrinning faces filled us with a shuddering horror.  So vivid and #NN#\r\nwas the impression that I can live over again that slow descent of the\r\nstation hill, the passing by the nurse-girl with the two babes, the sight\r\nof the old horse on his knees between the shafts, the cabman twisted\r\nacross his seat, and the young man inside with his hand upon the open\r\ndoor in the very act of springing out.  Lower down were six reapers all\r\nin a litter, their limbs crossing, their dead, #VBG# eyes gazing\r\nupwards at the glare of heaven.  These things I see as in a photograph.\r\nBut soon, by the merciful provision of nature, the #VBN# nerve\r\nceased to respond.  The very #NN# of the horror took away from its\r\npersonal appeal.  #NNS# merged into groups, groups into #NNS#,\r\ncrowds into a universal phenomenon which one soon accepted as the\r\ninevitable detail of every scene.  Only here and there, where some\r\nparticularly brutal or grotesque incident caught the attention, did the\r\nmind come back with a sudden shock to the personal and human meaning of\r\nit all.",
    "Above all, there was the fate of the children.  That, I remember, filled\r\nus with the strongest sense of intolerable injustice.  We could have\r\n#NNS#. Challenger did #NN# we passed a great council school and\r\nsaw the long trail of tiny figures scattered down the road which led from\r\nit.  They had been dismissed by their terrified #NNS# and were\r\nspeeding for their #NNS# when the poison caught them in its net.  Great\r\nnumbers of people were at the open windows of the houses.  In #NN#\r\n#NNP# there was hardly one which had not its staring, smiling face.  At\r\nthe last instant the need of air, that very #VBG# for oxygen which we\r\nalone had been able to satisfy, had sent them flying to the window.  The\r\n#NNS# too were littered with men and women, #NN# and #NN#,\r\nwho had rushed out of the houses.  Many of them had fallen in the\r\nroadway.  It was a lucky thing that in Lord John we had found an expert\r\ndriver, for it was no easy matter to pick one's way.  Passing through the\r\nvillages or #NNS# we could only go at a walking pace, and once, I\r\nremember, opposite the school at #NN#, we had to halt some time\r\nwhile we carried aside the bodies which blocked our path.",
    "A few small, definite pictures stand out in my memory from amid that long\r\npanorama of death upon the Sussex and #NN# high #NNS#.  One was that\r\nof a great, glittering motor-car standing outside the inn at the village\r\nof #NN#.  It bore, as I should guess, some pleasure party upon\r\ntheir return from Brighton or from #NN#.  There were three #RB#\r\ndressed women, all young and beautiful, one of them with a #VBG# #NN#\r\nupon her lap.  With them were a #VBG# elderly man and a young\r\n#NN#, his #NN# still in his eye, his cigarette burned down to\r\nthe stub between the fingers of his #VBN# hand.  Death must have come\r\non them in an instant and fixed them as they sat.  Save that the elderly\r\nman had at the last moment torn out his collar in an effort to #VB#,\r\nthey might all have been asleep.  On one side of the car a #NN# with\r\nsome broken glasses beside a tray was huddled near the step.  On the\r\nother, two very ragged tramps, a man and a woman, lay where they had\r\nfallen, the man with his long, thin arm still outstretched, even as he\r\nhad asked for #NNS# in his lifetime.  One instant of time had put\r\naristocrat, waiter, tramp, and dog upon one common #VBG# of #JJ# and\r\n#VBG# #NN#.",
    "I remember another singular picture, some miles on the London side of\r\n#NNS#.  There is a large #NN# upon the left, with a long, green\r\nslope in front of it.  Upon this slope were assembled a great number of\r\nschool children, all kneeling at #NN#.  In front of them was a fringe\r\nof #NNS#, and higher up the slope, facing towards them, a single figure\r\nwhom we took to be the #NNP# #NNP#.  #IN# the pleasure-seekers in\r\nthe motor-car, these people seemed to have had warning of their danger\r\nand to have died #RB# together, the teachers and the #VBN#,\r\nassembled for their last common lesson.",
    "My mind is still stunned by that terrific experience, and I grope vainly\r\nfor means of expression by which I can reproduce the emotions which we\r\nfelt.  Perhaps it is best and wisest not to try, but merely to indicate\r\nthe facts.  Even Summerlee and Challenger were crushed, and we heard\r\nnothing of our companions behind us save an occasional whimper from the\r\nlady.  As to Lord John, he was too intent upon his wheel and the\r\ndifficult task of #VBG# his way along such roads to have time or\r\n#NN# for conversation.  One phrase he used with such wearisome\r\n#NN# that it stuck in my memory and at last almost made me laugh as\r\na comment upon the day of doom.",
    "\"Pretty doin's!  What!\"",
    "That was his ejaculation as each fresh tremendous combination of death\r\nand disaster #VBN# itself before us.  \"Pretty doin's!  What!\" he\r\ncried, as we descended the station hill at Rotherfield, and it was still\r\n\"Pretty doin's!  What!\" as we picked our way through a wilderness of\r\ndeath in the High Street of #NN# and the Old Kent Road.",
    "It was here that we received a sudden and amazing shock.  Out of the\r\nwindow of a humble corner house there appeared a #VBG# handkerchief\r\nwaving at the end of a long, thin human arm.  Never had the sight of\r\nunexpected death caused our hearts to stop and then throb so wildly as\r\ndid this amazing indication of life.  Lord John ran the motor to the\r\ncurb, and in an instant we had rushed through the open door of the house\r\nand up the staircase to the #JJ# front room from which the signal\r\nproceeded.",
    "A very old lady sat in a chair by the open window, and close to her, laid\r\nacross a second chair, was a cylinder of oxygen, smaller but of the same\r\nshape as those which had saved our own lives.  She turned her thin,\r\ndrawn, bespectacled face toward us as we crowded in at the doorway.",
    "\"I feared that I was abandoned here forever,\" said she, \"for I am an\r\ninvalid and cannot #VB#.\"",
    "\"Well, madam,\" Challenger answered, \"it is a lucky chance that we\r\nhappened to pass.\"",
    "\"I have one #JJ# question to ask you,\" said she.  \"Gentlemen, I\r\nbeg that you will be frank with me.  What effect will these events have\r\nupon London and #NN# #NNP# shares?\"",
    "We should have laughed had it not been for the tragic eagerness with\r\nwhich she listened for our answer.  Mrs. #NN#, for that was her name,\r\nwas an #VBN# #NN#, whose whole #NN# depended upon a small holding of\r\nthis stock.  Her life had been #VBN# by the rise and fall of the\r\n#NN#, and she could form no conception of existence save as it was\r\naffected by the quotation of her shares.  In vain we pointed out to her\r\nthat all the money in the world was hers for the taking and was useless\r\nwhen taken.  Her old mind would not adapt itself to the new idea, and she\r\n#VBD# loudly over her vanished stock.  \"It was all I had,\" she wailed.\r\n\"If that is gone I may as well go too.\"",
    "#IN# her #NNS# we found out how this frail old plant had lived\r\nwhere the whole great forest had fallen.  She was a #VBN# invalid and\r\nan asthmatic.  Oxygen had been #VBN# for her #NN#, and a tube was\r\nin her room at the moment of the crisis.  She had naturally #VBN# some\r\nas had been her habit when there was a difficulty with her breathing.  It\r\nhad given her relief, and by #VBG# out her supply she had managed to\r\nsurvive the night.  Finally she had fallen asleep and been awakened by\r\nthe buzz of our motor-car.  As it was impossible to take her on with us,\r\nwe saw that she had all #NNS# of life and promised to communicate\r\nwith her in a couple of days at the latest.  So we left her, still\r\nweeping bitterly over her vanished stock.",
    "As we approached the Thames the block in the streets became thicker and\r\nthe #NNS# more bewildering.  It was with difficulty that we made our\r\nway across London Bridge.  The approaches to it upon the #NNP# side\r\nwere choked from end to end with frozen traffic which made all further\r\nadvance in that direction impossible.  A ship was blazing brightly\r\n#IN# one of the #NNS# near the bridge, and the air was full of\r\ndrifting #NN# and of a heavy #JJ# smell of burning.  There was a cloud\r\nof dense smoke somewhere near the #NNS# of Parliament, but it was\r\nimpossible from where we were to see what was on fire.",
    "\"I don't know how it strikes you,\" Lord John remarked as he brought his\r\nengine to a #JJ#, \"but it seems to me the country is more cheerful\r\nthan the town.  Dead London is gettin' on my nerves.  I'm for a cast\r\nround and then gettin' back to Rotherfield.\"",
    "\"I confess that I do not see what we can hope for here,\" said Professor\r\nSummerlee.",
    "\"At the same time,\" said Challenger, his great voice booming strangely\r\namid the silence, \"it is difficult for us to conceive that out of seven\r\nmillions of people there is only this one old woman who by some\r\npeculiarity of constitution or some accident of #NN# has managed to\r\nsurvive this catastrophe.\"",
    "\"If there should be others, how can we hope to find them, George?\" asked\r\nthe lady.  \"And yet I agree with you that we cannot go back until we have\r\ntried.\"",
    "#VBG# out of the car and leaving it by the curb, we walked with some\r\ndifficulty along the crowded pavement of King William Street and entered\r\nthe open door of a large insurance office.  It was a corner house, and we\r\nchose it as commanding a view in every direction.  #VBG# the stair,\r\nwe passed through what I suppose to have been the #NN#, for eight\r\nelderly men were seated round a long table in the centre of it.  The high\r\nwindow was open and we all #VBN# out upon the balcony.  From it we\r\ncould see the crowded city streets #VBG# in every direction, while\r\nbelow us the road was black from side to side with the tops of the\r\nmotionless #NNS#.  All, or nearly all, had their heads pointed outwards,\r\nshowing how the terrified men of the city had at the last moment made a\r\nvain endeavor to rejoin their #NNS# in the #NNS# or the country.\r\nHere and there amid the humbler #NNS# towered the great #VBN#\r\nmotor-car of some wealthy #NN#, wedged hopelessly among the #VBN#\r\nstream of arrested traffic.  Just beneath us there was such a one of\r\ngreat size and luxurious appearance, with its owner, a fat old man,\r\nleaning out, half his gross body through the window, and his #NN# hand,\r\ngleaming with diamonds, outstretched as he #VBD# his chauffeur to make a\r\nlast effort to break through the press.",
    "A dozen #NN# towered up like islands in this flood, the passengers\r\nwho crowded the roofs lying all #VBN# together and across each others'\r\n#NNS# like a child's #NNS# in a #NN#.  On a broad lamp pedestal in the\r\ncentre of the roadway, a #RB# policeman was standing, leaning his back\r\nagainst the post in so natural an attitude that it was hard to realize\r\nthat he was not alive, while at his feet there lay a ragged #NN# with\r\nhis bundle of papers on the ground beside him.  A #NN# had got\r\nblocked in the crowd, and we could read in large letters, black upon\r\nyellow, \"#NNP# at Lord's.  #NNP# #NNP# #VBN#.\"  This must have\r\nbeen the earliest #NN#, for there were other #NNS# bearing the\r\nlegend, \"Is It the End?  Great #NN#'s #VBG#.\"  And another, \"Is\r\nChallenger #VBN#?  #JJ# #NNS#.\"",
    "Challenger pointed the latter placard out to his wife, as it thrust\r\nitself like a #NN# above the throng.  I could see him throw out his\r\nchest and stroke his beard as he looked at it.  It pleased and #VBN#\r\nthat complex mind to think that London had died with his name and his\r\nwords still present in their thoughts.  His feelings were so evident that\r\nthey aroused the sardonic comment of his colleague.",
    "\"In the limelight to the last, Challenger,\" he remarked.",
    "\"So it would appear,\" he answered complacently.  \"Well,\" he added as he\r\nlooked down the long vista of the radiating streets, all silent and all\r\n#VBN# up with death, \"I really see no purpose to be served by our\r\nstaying any longer in London.  I suggest that we return at once to\r\nRotherfield and then take #NN# as to how we shall most profitably\r\nemploy the years which lie before us.\"",
    "Only one other picture shall I give of the scenes which we carried back\r\nin our memories from the dead city.  It is a glimpse which we had of the\r\ninterior of the old church of St.  Mary's, which is at the very point\r\nwhere our car was awaiting us.  #VBG# our way among the prostrate\r\nfigures upon the steps, we pushed open the swing door and entered.  It\r\nwas a wonderful sight.  The church was #VBN# from end to end with\r\n#VB#ing figures in every #NN# of #NN# and #NN#.  At the\r\nlast dreadful moment, brought suddenly face to face with the #NNS# of\r\nlife, those terrific realities which hang over us even while we follow\r\nthe shadows, the terrified people had rushed into those old city churches\r\nwhich for generations had hardly ever held a #NN#.  There they\r\nhuddled as close as they could kneel, many of them in their agitation\r\nstill wearing their hats, while above them in the #NN# a young man in\r\nlay dress had apparently been addressing them when he and they had been\r\noverwhelmed by the same fate.  He lay now, like #VB# in his #NN#, with\r\nhis head and two limp arms hanging over the ledge of the pulpit.  It was\r\na nightmare, the grey, #JJ# church, the rows of agonized figures, the\r\n#NN# and silence of it all.  We moved about with hushed whispers,\r\nwalking upon our #NNS#.",
    "And then suddenly I had an idea.  At one corner of the church, near the\r\ndoor, stood the ancient #NN#, and behind it a deep #NN# in which there\r\nhung the ropes for the #NNS#.  Why should we not send a message\r\nout over London which would #VB# to us anyone who might still be\r\nalive?  I ran across, and pulling at the #VBN# rope, I was\r\nsurprised to find how difficult it was to swing the bell.  Lord John had\r\nfollowed me.",
    "\"By George, young fellah!\" said he, pulling off his coat.  \"You've hit on\r\na dooced good notion.  Give me a grip and we'll soon have a move on it.\"",
    "But, even then, so heavy was the bell that it was not until Challenger\r\nand Summerlee had added their weight to ours that we heard the roaring\r\nand #VBG# above our heads which told us that the great #NN# was\r\nringing out its music.  Far over dead London resounded our message of\r\ncomradeship and hope to any fellow-man surviving.  It cheered our own\r\nhearts, that strong, #JJ# call, and we turned the more earnestly to\r\nour work, dragged two feet off the earth with each upward jerk of the\r\nrope, but all straining together on the #JJ# heave, Challenger the\r\nlowest of all, bending all his great strength to the task and #VBG# up\r\nand down like a monstrous bull-frog, croaking with every #NN#.  It was at\r\nthat moment that an artist might have taken a picture of the four\r\nadventurers, the comrades of many strange #NNS# in the past, whom fate\r\nhad now chosen for so supreme an experience.  For half an hour we worked,\r\nthe sweat dropping from our faces, our arms and backs aching with the\r\nexertion.  Then we went out into the #NN# of the church and looked\r\neagerly up and down the silent, crowded streets.  Not a sound, not a\r\nmotion, in answer to our summons.",
    "\"It's no use.  No one is left,\" I cried.",
    "\"We can do nothing more,\" said Mrs. Challenger.  \"For God's sake, George,\r\nlet us get back to Rotherfield.  Another hour of this dreadful, silent\r\ncity would #VB# me mad.\"",
    "We got into the car without another word.  Lord John #VBN# her round and\r\nturned her to the south.  To us the chapter seemed closed.  Little did we\r\nforesee the strange new chapter which was to open.",
    "Chapter VI",
    "THE GREAT AWAKENING",
    "And now I come to the end of this extraordinary incident, so\r\n#VBG# in its importance, not only in our own small, individual\r\nlives, but in the general history of the human race.  As I said when I\r\nbegan my narrative, when that history comes to be written, this\r\noccurrence will surely stand out among all other events like a mountain\r\ntowering among its foothills.  Our generation has been reserved for a\r\nvery special fate since it has been chosen to experience so wonderful a\r\nthing.  How long its effect may #NN# long mankind may preserve the\r\n#NN# and reverence which this great shock has taught #NN# only be\r\nshown by the future.  I think it is safe to say that things can never be\r\nquite the same again.  Never can one realize how powerless and ignorant\r\none is, and how one is upheld by an unseen hand, until for an instant\r\nthat hand has seemed to close and to crush.  Death has been imminent upon\r\nus.  We know that at any moment it may be again.  That grim presence\r\nshadows our lives, but who can deny that in that shadow the sense of\r\nduty, the feeling of #NN# and responsibility, the appreciation of the\r\ngravity and of the objects of life, the earnest desire to develop and\r\nimprove, have grown and become real with us to a degree that has #VBD#\r\nour whole society from end to end?  It is something beyond #NNS# and\r\nbeyond #NNS#.  It is rather an alteration of #NN#, a shifting of\r\nour sense of proportion, a vivid #NN# that we are insignificant\r\nand #NN# creatures, existing on #NN# and at the mercy of the\r\nfirst chill wind from the unknown.  But if the world has grown graver\r\nwith this knowledge it is not, I think, a sadder place in consequence.\r\nSurely we are agreed that the more sober and restrained #NNS# of the\r\npresent are deeper as well as wiser than the noisy, foolish hustle which\r\npassed so often for enjoyment in the days of #NNS# so recent and yet\r\nalready so inconceivable.  Those empty lives which were wasted in aimless\r\nvisiting and being visited, in the worry of great and unnecessary\r\n#NNS#, in the arranging and #VBG# of elaborate and #JJ# meals,\r\nhave now found rest and health in the reading, the music, the gentle\r\nfamily communion which comes from a simpler and saner division of their\r\ntime.  With greater health and greater pleasure they are #JJR# than\r\nbefore, even after they have paid those increased #NNS# to the\r\ncommon fund which have so raised the standard of life in these islands.",
    "There is some clash of opinion as to the exact hour of the great\r\nawakening.  It is generally agreed that, apart from the difference of\r\nclocks, there may have been local causes which influenced the action of\r\nthe poison.  Certainly, in each separate district the #NN# was\r\npractically simultaneous.  There are numerous witnesses that #NNP# #NNP#\r\npointed to ten minutes past six at the moment.  The #NN# Royal has\r\nfixed the #NNP# time at twelve past six.  On the other hand, #NNP#\r\nJohnson, a very capable East #NNP# observer, has recorded #NN# as\r\nthe hour.  In the #NNS# it was as late as seven.  In our own case\r\nthere can be no doubt whatever, for I was seated in Challenger's study\r\nwith his carefully tested #NN# in front of me at the moment.  The\r\nhour was a quarter-past six.",
    "An enormous depression was weighing upon my spirits.  The cumulative\r\neffect of all the dreadful sights which we had seen upon our journey was\r\nheavy upon my soul.  With my #VBG# animal health and great physical\r\nenergy any kind of mental #VBG# was a rare event.  I had the Irish\r\n#NN# of seeing some gleam of humor in every darkness.  But now the\r\nobscurity was appalling and #JJ#.  The others were downstairs\r\nmaking their plans for the future.  I sat by the open window, my chin\r\nresting upon my hand and my mind absorbed in the misery of our situation.\r\nCould we continue to live?  That was the question which I had begun to\r\nask myself.  Was it possible to exist upon a dead world?  Just as in\r\n#NN# the greater body draws to itself the lesser, would we not feel an\r\noverpowering attraction from that vast body of humanity which had passed\r\ninto the unknown?  How would the end come?  Would it be from a return of\r\nthe poison?  Or would the earth be #JJ# from the mephitic\r\nproducts of universal decay?  Or, finally, might our awful situation prey\r\nupon and #NN# our minds?  A group of insane folk upon a dead world!\r\nMy mind was brooding upon this last dreadful idea when some slight noise\r\ncaused me to look down upon the road beneath me.  The old cab horse was\r\ncoming up the hill!",
    "I was conscious at the same instant of the #VBG# of birds, of\r\nsomeone #VBG# in the yard below, and of a background of movement in\r\nthe landscape.  And yet I remember that it was that absurd, emaciated,\r\n#VBN# cab-horse which held my gaze.  Slowly and #RB# it was\r\nclimbing the slope.  Then my eye traveled to the driver sitting hunched\r\nup upon the box and finally to the young man who was leaning out of the\r\nwindow in some excitement and shouting a direction.  They were all\r\n#RB#, #RB# alive!",
    "Everybody was alive once more!  Had it all been a delusion?  Was it\r\nconceivable that this whole poison belt incident had been an elaborate\r\ndream?  For an instant my startled brain was really ready to believe it.\r\nThen I looked down, and there was the rising blister on my hand where it\r\nwas #JJ# by the rope of the city bell.  It had really been so, then.\r\nAnd yet here was the world #NN# was life come back in an\r\ninstant full tide to the planet.  Now, as my eyes wandered all over the\r\ngreat landscape, I saw it in every #NN# moving, to my\r\namazement, in the very same groove in which it had halted.  There were\r\nthe golfers.  Was it possible that they were going on with their game?\r\nYes, there was a fellow driving off from a #NN#, and that other group upon\r\nthe green were surely putting for the hole.  The reapers were slowly\r\n#VBG# back to their work.  The nurse-girl slapped one of her #NNS#\r\nand then began to push the perambulator up the hill.  Everyone had\r\n#RB# taken up the thread at the very point where they had\r\ndropped it.",
    "I rushed downstairs, but the hall door was open, and I heard the voices\r\nof my companions, loud in astonishment and congratulation, in the yard.\r\nHow we all #NN# hands and laughed as we came together, and how Mrs.\r\nChallenger #VBD# us all in her emotion, before she finally threw herself\r\ninto the #NN# of her husband.",
    "\"But they could not have been asleep!\" cried Lord John.  \"#NNP# it all,\r\nChallenger, you don't mean to believe that those folk were asleep with\r\ntheir staring eyes and stiff limbs and that awful death grin on their\r\nfaces!\"",
    "\"It can only have been the condition that is called #NN#,\" said\r\nChallenger.  \"It has been a rare phenomenon in the past and has\r\nconstantly been mistaken for death.  While it #VBZ#, the temperature\r\nfalls, the #NN# #VBZ#, the #NN# is #NN#\r\nfact, it _is_ death, save that it is evanescent.  Even the most\r\n#JJ# mind\"--here he closed his eyes and #NN#\"could hardly\r\nconceive a universal outbreak of it in this fashion.\"",
    "\"You may label it catalepsy,\" remarked Summerlee, \"but, after all, that\r\nis only a name, and we know as little of the result as we do of the\r\npoison which has caused it.  The most we can say is that the #VBN#\r\nether has produced a temporary death.\"",
    "Austin was seated all in a heap on the step of the car.  It was his\r\ncoughing which I had heard from above.  He had been holding his head in\r\nsilence, but now he was #VBG# to himself and running his eyes over\r\nthe car.",
    "\"Young #NN#!\" he grumbled.  \"Can't leave things alone!\"",
    "\"What's the matter, Austin?\"",
    "\"#NNS# left running, sir.  Someone has been #VBG# with the car.\r\nI expect it's that young garden boy, sir.\"",
    "Lord John looked guilty.",
    "\"I don't know what's amiss with me,\" continued Austin, staggering to his\r\nfeet.  \"I expect I came over queer when I was #VBG# her down.  I seem to\r\nremember flopping over by the step.  But I'll swear I never left those\r\n#NN# taps on.\"",
    "In a condensed narrative the astonished Austin was told what had happened\r\nto himself and the world.  The mystery of the #VBG# #NNS# was\r\nalso explained to him.  He listened with an air of deep distrust when\r\ntold how an amateur had driven his car and with absorbed interest to the\r\nfew sentences in which our experiences of the sleeping city were\r\nrecorded.  I can remember his comment when the story was concluded.",
    "\"Was you outside the Bank of England, sir?\"",
    "\"Yes, Austin.\"",
    "\"With all them millions inside and everybody asleep?\"",
    "\"That was so.\"",
    "\"And I not there!\" he groaned, and turned #RB# once more to the\r\nhosing of his car.",
    "There was a sudden #VBG# of wheels upon gravel.  The old cab had\r\nactually pulled up at Challenger's door.  I saw the young #NN# step\r\nout from it.  An instant later the maid, who looked as #VBN# and\r\nbewildered as if she had that instant been aroused from the deepest\r\nsleep, appeared with a card upon a tray.  Challenger snorted #RB#\r\nas he looked at it, and his thick black hair seemed to bristle up in his\r\nwrath.",
    "\"A #NN#!\" he growled.  Then with a deprecating smile:  \"After all, it\r\nis natural that the whole world should hasten to know what I think of\r\nsuch an episode.\"",
    "\"That can hardly be his errand,\" said Summerlee, \"for he was on the road\r\nin his cab before ever the crisis came.\"",
    "I looked at the card:  \"James Baxter, London Correspondent, New York\r\n#NNP#.\"",
    "\"You'll see him?\" said I.",
    "\"Not I.\"",
    "\"Oh, George!  You should be #JJR# and more considerate to others.\r\nSurely you have learned something from what we have undergone.\"",
    "He #VBN# and shook his big, obstinate head.",
    "\"A poisonous breed!  Eh, Malone?  The worst #VBN# in modern civilization,\r\nthe ready tool of the quack and the #NN# of the #JJ# man!\r\nWhen did they ever say a good word for me?\"",
    "\"When did you ever say a good word to them?\" I answered.  \"Come, sir,\r\nthis is a stranger who has made a journey to see you.  I am sure that you\r\nwon't be rude to him.\"",
    "\"Well, well,\" he grumbled, \"you come with me and do the talking.  I\r\nprotest in advance against any such outrageous invasion of my private\r\nlife.\"  #VBG# and #VBG#, he came rolling after me like an angry\r\nand rather ill-conditioned mastiff.",
    "The dapper young American pulled out his notebook and plunged instantly\r\ninto his subject.",
    "\"I came down, sir,\" said he, \"because our people in America would very\r\nmuch like to hear more about this danger which is, in your opinion,\r\npressing upon the world.\"",
    "\"I know of no danger which is now pressing upon the world,\" Challenger\r\nanswered gruffly.",
    "The pressman looked at him in #JJ# surprise.",
    "\"I meant, sir, the chances that the world might run into a belt of\r\npoisonous ether.\"",
    "\"I do not now #VB# any such danger,\" said Challenger.",
    "The pressman looked even more perplexed.",
    "\"You are Professor Challenger, are you not?\" he asked.",
    "\"Yes, sir; that is my name.\"",
    "\"I cannot understand, then, how you can say that there is no such danger.\r\nI am alluding to your own letter, published above your name in the London\r\nTimes of this morning.\"",
    "It was Challenger's turn to look surprised.",
    "\"This morning?\" said he.  \"No London Times was published this morning.\"",
    "\"Surely, sir,\" said the American in mild remonstrance, \"you must admit\r\nthat the London Times is a daily paper.\"  He drew out a copy from his\r\ninside pocket.  \"Here is the letter to which I #VB#.\"",
    "Challenger chuckled and rubbed his hands.",
    "\"I begin to understand,\" said he.  \"So you read this letter this morning?\"",
    "\"And came at once to interview me?\"",
    "\"Did you observe anything unusual upon the journey down?\"",
    "\"Well, to tell the truth, your people seemed more lively and generally\r\nhuman than I have ever seen them.  The baggage man set out to tell me a\r\nfunny story, and that's a new experience for me in this country.\"",
    "\"Nothing else?\"",
    "\"Why, no, sir, not that I can recall.\"",
    "\"Well, now, what hour did you leave Victoria?\"",
    "The American smiled.",
    "\"I came here to interview you, Professor, but it seems to be a case of\r\n'Is this nigger fishing, or is this fish #VBG#?' You're doing most of\r\nthe work.\"",
    "\"It happens to interest me.  Do you recall the hour?\"",
    "\"Sure.  It was half-past twelve.\"",
    "\"And you arrived?\"",
    "\"At a quarter-past two.\"",
    "\"And you hired a cab?\"",
    "\"How far do you suppose it is to the station?\"",
    "\"Well, I should reckon the best part of two miles.\"",
    "\"So how long do you think it took you?\"",
    "\"Well, half an hour, maybe, with that asthmatic in front.\"",
    "\"So it should be three o'clock?\"",
    "\"Yes, or a trifle after it.\"",
    "\"Look at your watch.\"",
    "The American did so and then stared at us in astonishment.",
    "\"Say!\" he cried.  \"It's run down.  That horse has broken every record,\r\nsure.  The sun is pretty low, now that I come to look at it.  Well,\r\nthere's something here I don't understand.\"",
    "\"Have you no remembrance of anything remarkable as you came up the hill?\"",
    "\"Well, I seem to recollect that I was mighty #JJ# once.  It comes back\r\nto me that I wanted to say something to the driver and that I couldn't\r\nmake him heed me.  I guess it was the heat, but I felt #NN# for a\r\nmoment.  That's all.\"",
    "\"So it is with the whole human race,\" said Challenger to me.  \"They have\r\nall #NN# swimmy for a moment.  None of them have as yet any comprehension\r\nof what has occurred.  Each will go on with his interrupted job as Austin\r\nhas #VBD# up his #NN# or the golfer continued his game.  Your\r\neditor, Malone, will continue the issue of his papers, and very much\r\namazed he will be at finding that an issue is missing.  Yes, my young\r\nfriend,\" he added to the American reporter, with a sudden mood of amused\r\n#NN#, \"it may interest you to know that the world has swum through\r\nthe poisonous current which #NNS# like the Gulf Stream through the ocean\r\nof ether.  You will also kindly note for your own future convenience that\r\nto-day is not Friday, August the twenty-seventh, but Saturday, August the\r\n#JJ#, and that you sat senseless in your cab for #NN#\r\nhours upon the Rotherfield hill.\"",
    "And \"right here,\" as my American colleague would say, I may bring this\r\nnarrative to an end.  It is, as you are probably aware, only a fuller and\r\nmore #VBN# version of the account which appeared in the Monday edition\r\nof the Daily #NN# account which has been #RB# admitted to\r\nbe the greatest journalistic scoop of all time, which sold no fewer than\r\n#JJ# million copies of the paper.  #VBN# upon the wall of my\r\nsanctum I retain those magnificent headlines:--",

    "\"It has been a #JJ# #NN#,\" said the Times, \"that our human race\r\nare a feeble folk before the infinite #JJ# forces which surround us.\r\nFrom the prophets of old and from the philosophers of our own time the\r\nsame message and warning have reached us.

I had a #NN# bullet\r\nthrough it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from\r\nwalking, it ached wearily at every change of the #NN#.",
    "\"My practice has extended recently to the Continent,\" said Holmes,\r\nafter a while, filling up his old #NN# pipe.  \"I was #VBN#\r\nlast week by #NNP# #NNP# #NNP#, who, as you probably know, has come\r\nrather to the front lately in the French detective service.  He has all\r\nthe Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is #JJ# in the wide\r\nrange of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments\r\nof his art.  The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some\r\nfeatures of interest.  I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,\r\nthe one at #NNP# in #CD#, and the other at St. Louis in #CD#, which have\r\nsuggested to him the true solution.  Here is the letter which I had\r\nthis morning #VBG# my assistance.\"  He tossed over, as he\r\nspoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign #NN#. I glanced my eyes down\r\nit, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with #JJ#\r\n\"#NNS#,\" \"#NNS#,\" and \"#NN#,\" all #VBG#\r\nto the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.",
    "\"He speaks as a #NN# to his master,\" said I.",
    "\"Oh, he #NNS# my assistance too highly,\" said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.\r\n\"He has considerable gifts himself.  He #VBZ# two out of the three\r\nqualities necessary for the ideal detective.  He has the power of\r\nobservation and that of deduction.  He is only wanting in knowledge;\r\nand that may come in time.  He is now #VBG# my small works into\r\nFrench.\"",
    "\"Your works?\"",
    "\"Oh, didn't you know?\" he cried, laughing.  \"Yes, I have been guilty of\r\nseveral monographs.  They are all upon technical subjects.  Here, for\r\nexample, is one 'Upon the #NN# between the #NNS# of the #JJ#\r\n#NNS#.'  In it I #NN# a hundred and forty forms of #NN#,\r\n#NN#, and #NN#, with colored plates #VBG# the\r\ndifference in the ash.  It is a point which is continually turning up\r\nin criminal #NNS#, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a\r\nclue.  If you can say #RB#, for example, that some murder has\r\nbeen done by a man who was smoking an Indian #NN#, it obviously\r\nnarrows your field of search.  To the trained eye there is as much\r\ndifference between the black ash of a #RB# and the white fluff\r\nof bird's-eye as there is between a #NN# and a #NN#.\"",
    "\"You have an extraordinary genius for #NNS#,\" I remarked.",
    "\"I appreciate their importance.  Here is my monograph upon the tracing\r\nof footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of #NN# of Paris as a\r\n#NN# of #VBZ#. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the\r\ninfluence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with #NNS# of the\r\nhands of #NN#, sailors, #NNS#, #NN#, #NNS#, and\r\n#NN#.  That is a matter of great practical interest to the\r\nscientific detective,#RB# in cases of #JJ# bodies, or in\r\ndiscovering the #NNS# of criminals.  But I weary you with my\r\nhobby.\"",
    "\"Not at all,\" I answered, earnestly.  \"It is of the greatest interest\r\nto me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your\r\npractical #NN# of it.  But you spoke just now of observation and\r\ndeduction.  Surely the one to some extent #VBZ# the other.\"",
    "\"Why, hardly,\" he answered, leaning back #RB# in his arm-chair,\r\nand sending up thick blue #NNS# from his pipe.  \"For example,\r\nobservation shows me that you have been to the #NN# Street\r\nPost-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there\r\nyou dispatched a telegram.\"",
    "\"Right!\" said I.  \"Right on both points!  But I confess that I don't\r\nsee how you arrived at it.  It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I\r\nhave mentioned it to no one.\"",
    "\"It is simplicity itself,\" he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,--\"so\r\nabsurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may\r\nserve to define the limits of observation and of deduction.\r\n#NN# tells me that you have a little reddish #VB# #VBG# to\r\nyour #NN#.  Just opposite the #NNP# Street Office they have taken\r\nup the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that\r\nit is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering.  The earth is of\r\nthis peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, #RB#\r\nelse in the neighborhood.  So much is observation.  The rest is\r\ndeduction.\"",
    "\"How, then, did you #VB# the telegram?\"",
    "\"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat\r\nopposite to you all morning.  I see also in your open desk there that\r\nyou have a sheet of #NNS# and a thick bundle of #NN#.  What\r\ncould you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire?\r\n#VB# all other factors, and the one which remains must be the\r\ntruth.\"",
    "\"In this case it certainly is so,\" I replied, after a little thought.\r\n\"The thing, however, is, as you say, of the #JJS#. Would you think\r\nme impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\"",
    "\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it would prevent me from taking a\r\nsecond #NN# of cocaine.  I should be delighted to look into any problem\r\nwhich you might submit to me.\"",
    "\"I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object\r\nin daily use without leaving the impress of his #NN# upon it\r\nin such a way that a trained observer might read it.  Now, I have here\r\na watch which has recently come into my possession.  Would you have the\r\nkindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the\r\nlate owner?\"",
    "I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my\r\nheart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I\r\nintended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he\r\noccasionally assumed.  He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at\r\nthe #JJ#, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked\r\neyes and then with a powerful #JJ# lens.  I could hardly keep from\r\nsmiling at his #JJ# face when he finally snapped the case to and\r\nhanded it back.",
    "\"There are hardly any data,\" he remarked.  \"The watch has been recently\r\ncleaned, which #VBZ# me of my most suggestive facts.\"",
    "\"You are right,\" I answered.  \"It was cleaned before being sent to me.\"\r\nIn my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most #JJ# and\r\nimpotent excuse to cover his #NN#.  What data could he expect from\r\nan #VBN# watch?",
    "\"Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\" he\r\nobserved, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, #NN# eyes.\r\n\"#NN# to your #NN#, I should judge that the watch belonged to\r\nyour elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\"",
    "\"That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\"",
    "\"Quite so.  The W. suggests your own name.  The date of the watch is\r\nnearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch:  so\r\nit was made for the last generation.  #NN# usually #VBZ# to the\r\n#JJS# son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father.\r\nYour father has, if I remember right, been dead many years.  It has,\r\ntherefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\"",
    "\"Right, so far,\" said I.  \"Anything else?\"",
    "\"He was a man of untidy habits,#NN# untidy and careless.  He was left\r\nwith good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time\r\nin #NN# with occasional short intervals of #NN#, and finally,\r\ntaking to drink, he died.  That is all I can gather.\"",
    "I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with\r\nconsiderable bitterness in my heart.",
    "\"This is unworthy of you, Holmes,\" I said.  \"I could not have believed\r\nthat you would have descended to this.  You have made #NNS# into the\r\nhistory of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this\r\nknowledge in some fanciful way.  You cannot expect me to believe that\r\nyou have read all this from his old watch!  It is unkind, and, to speak\r\nplainly, has a touch of #NN# in it.\"",
    "\"My dear doctor,\" said he, kindly, \"pray accept my apologies. #VBG#\r\nthe matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and\r\npainful a thing it might be to you.  I assure you, however, that I\r\nnever even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\"",
    "\"Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?\r\nThey are absolutely correct in every particular.\"",
    "\"Ah, that is good luck.  I could only say what was the balance of\r\nprobability.  I did not at all #NN# to be so accurate.\"",
    "\"But it was not mere #NN#?\"",
    "\"No, no:  I never guess.  It is a shocking habit,#NN# to the\r\n#JJ# faculty.  What seems strange to you is only so because you do\r\nnot follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which\r\nlarge inferences may depend.  For example, I began by #VBG# that your\r\nbrother was careless.  When you observe the lower part of that\r\n#NN# you notice that it is not only #VBN# in two places, but it\r\nis cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard\r\nobjects, such as #NNS# or keys, in the same pocket.  Surely it is no\r\ngreat feat to assume that a man who #VBZ# a #NN# watch so\r\n#RB# must be a careless man.  Neither is it a very far-fetched\r\ninference that a man who #VBZ# one article of such value is pretty\r\nwell provided for in other #NNS#.\"",
    "I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.",
    "\"It is very customary for #NNS# in England, when they take a\r\nwatch, to #NN# the number of the ticket with a #JJ# upon the\r\ninside of the case.  It is more #JJ# than a label, as there is no risk\r\nof the number being lost or #VBN#.  There are no less than four\r\nsuch numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.\r\n#NN#,--that your brother was often at low water.  #JJ#\r\ninference,--that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could\r\nnot have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner\r\n#NN#, which contains the #NN#.  Look at the thousands of #NNS#\r\nall round the hole,#NNS# where the key has slipped.  What sober man's\r\nkey could have #VBD# those #NNS#?  But you will never see a\r\n#NN#'s watch without them.  He winds it at night, and he leaves\r\nthese traces of his unsteady hand.  Where is the mystery in all this?\"",
    "\"It is as clear as daylight,\" I answered.  \"I regret the injustice\r\nwhich I did you.  I should have had more faith in your marvellous\r\nfaculty.  May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot\r\nat present?\"",
    "\"None.  Hence the cocaine.  I cannot live without #NN#. What else\r\nis there to live for?  Stand at the window here.  Was ever such a\r\n#JJ#, dismal, unprofitable world?  See how the yellow fog swirls down\r\nthe street and drifts across the dun-colored houses.  What could be\r\nmore hopelessly prosaic and material?  What is the use of having\r\npowers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to #VB# them?  #NN#\r\nis commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those\r\nwhich are commonplace have any function upon earth.\"",
    "I had opened my mouth to reply to this #NN#, when with a crisp knock\r\nour landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.",
    "\"A young lady for you, sir,\" she said, addressing my companion.",
    "\"Miss Mary #NN#,\" he read.  \"Hum!  I have no recollection of the\r\nname.  Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson.  Don't go, doctor.\r\nI should prefer that you remain.\"",
    "The #NN# of the #NNP#",
    "Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an #RB# composure\r\nof manner.  She was a #JJ# young lady, small, dainty, well #VBN#,\r\nand dressed in the most perfect taste.  There was, however, a #NN#\r\nand simplicity about her #NN# which bore with it a suggestion of\r\nlimited means.  The dress was a sombre #NN# #JJ#, #VBN# and\r\n#VBN#, and she wore a small #NN# of the same dull #NN#, relieved\r\nonly by a suspicion of white #NN# in the side.  Her face had neither\r\n#NN# of feature nor beauty of #NN#, but her expression was\r\nsweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly #JJ#\r\nand sympathetic.  In an experience of women which extends over many\r\nnations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face\r\nwhich gave a clearer promise of a #JJ# and sensitive nature. I could\r\nnot but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed\r\nfor her, her lip #VBD#, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign\r\nof intense #RB# agitation.",
    "\"I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"because you once enabled\r\nmy employer, Mrs. #NNP# #NNP#, to #VB# a little domestic\r\ncomplication.  She was much impressed by your kindness and #NN#.\"",
    "\"Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\" he repeated thoughtfully.  \"I believe that I\r\nwas of some slight service to her.  The case, however, as I remember\r\nit, was a very simple one.\"",
    "\"She did not think so.  But at least you cannot say the same of mine.\r\nI can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable,\r\nthan the situation in which I find myself.\"",
    "Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes #VBD#.  He leaned forward in\r\nhis chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his\r\nclear-cut, #NN# features.  \"State your case,\" said he, in brisk,\r\nbusiness tones.",
    "I felt that my position was an embarrassing one.  \"You will, I am sure,\r\nexcuse me,\" I said, rising from my chair.",
    "To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.\r\n\"If your friend,\" she said, \"would be good enough to stop, he might be\r\nof inestimable service to me.\"",
    "I relapsed into my chair.",
    "\"#RB#,\" she continued, \"the facts are these.  My father was an\r\nofficer in an Indian #NN# who sent me home when I was quite a\r\nchild.  My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England.  I was\r\nplaced, however, in a comfortable #VBG# establishment at Edinburgh,\r\nand there I remained until I was seventeen years of age.  In the year\r\n#CD# my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve\r\nmonths' leave and came home.  He telegraphed to me from London that he\r\nhad arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the\r\nLangham Hotel as his address.  His message, as I remember, was full of\r\nkindness and love.  On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was\r\ninformed that #NNP# Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone\r\nout the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without\r\nnews of him.  That night, on the advice of the #NN# of the hotel, I\r\ncommunicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the\r\npapers.

    "\"#VBD# at the hotel.  There was nothing in it to suggest a\r\nclue,#NN# clothes, some books, and a considerable number of\r\ncuriosities from the #NN# #NNPS#.  He had been one of the officers\r\nin charge of the #NN# there.\"",
    "\"Had he any friends in town?\"",
    "\"Only one that we know of,#NN# #NN#, of his own regiment, the #CD#th\r\n#NNP# #NNP#.  The #JJ# had retired some little time before, and\r\nlived at #NNP# #NNP#.  We communicated with him, of course, but he\r\ndid not even know that his brother officer was in England.\"",
    "\"A singular case,\" remarked Holmes.",
    "\"I have not yet described to you the most singular part.  About six\r\nyears #NN# be exact, upon the #CD#th of May, #CD# advertisement\r\nappeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and\r\nstating that it would be to her advantage to come forward.  There was\r\nno name or address #VBN#.  I had at that time just entered the\r\nfamily of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess.  By her\r\nadvice I published my address in the advertisement column.  The same\r\nday there arrived through the post a small #NN# box addressed to\r\nme, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous #NN#.  No word\r\nof writing was enclosed.  Since then every year upon the same date\r\nthere has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl,\r\nwithout any clue as to the sender.  They have been pronounced by an\r\nexpert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value.  You can see\r\nfor yourselves that they are very handsome.\"  She opened a flat box as\r\nshe spoke, and showed me six of the finest #NNS# that I had ever seen.",
    "\"Your statement is most interesting,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"Has\r\nanything else occurred to you?\"",
    "\"Yes, and no later than to-day.  That is why I have come to you. This\r\nmorning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for\r\nyourself.\"",

    "\"That is exactly what I want to ask you.\"",
    "\"Then we shall most certainly go.  You and I #NNS#, why, Dr. Watson\r\nis the very man.  Your correspondent says two friends.  He and I have\r\nworked together before.\"",

    "\"You are certainly a #NN# client.  You have the correct intuition.\r\nLet us see, now.\"  He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave\r\nlittle darting glances from one to the other. \"They are #VBN#\r\nhands, except the letter,\" he said, presently, \"but there can be no\r\nquestion as to the #NN#.

    "\"Nothing could be more unlike.\"",
    "\"I expected to hear you say so.  We shall look out for you, then, at\r\nsix.  Pray allow me to keep the papers.  I may look into the matter\r\nbefore then.  It is only half-past three.  Au revoir, then.\"",
    "\"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from\r\none to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her #NN# and\r\nhurried away.

    "\"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive\r\nfact, that is all.  It is, however, VERY suggestive. The details are\r\nstill to be added.

    "\"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\"",
    "\"No?  You surprise me.  Look at it in this way, then.  Captain Morstan\r\ndisappears.  The only person in London whom he could have visited is\r\nMajor Sholto.

And why should the presents begin immediately after\r\nSholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's #NN# knows something of the\r\nmystery and desires to make compensation?  Have you any alternative\r\ntheory which will meet the facts?\"",
    "\"But what a strange compensation!  And how strangely made!  Why, too,\r\nshould he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the\r\nletter speaks of giving her justice.

By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's\r\ndesk which no one could understand.

    "Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.\r\nHe then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.",
    "\"It is paper of native Indian #VB#,\" he remarked.  \"It has at\r\nsome time been pinned to a board.  The diagram upon it appears to be a\r\nplan of part of a large building with numerous halls, #NNS#, and\r\npassages.  At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it\r\nis '#CD# from left,' in faded #VBG#. In the left-hand corner\r\nis a curious #NN# like four #VBZ# in a line with their arms\r\ntouching.  Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters,\r\n'The sign of the four,#NN# #JJ#, #NN# #NNP#, #NNP# #NNP#,\r\n#VBP# #NN#.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the\r\nmatter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance.  It has been kept\r\ncarefully in a #NN#; for the one side is as clean as the other.\"",
    "\"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\"",
    "\"#NNP# it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of\r\nuse to us.  I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much\r\ndeeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my\r\nideas.\"  He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow\r\nand his vacant eye that he was thinking intently.  Miss Morstan and I\r\nchatted in an #NN# about our present expedition and its possible\r\n#NN#, but our companion maintained his #JJ# reserve until\r\nthe end of our journey.",
    "It was a #NNP# evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had\r\nbeen a dreary one, and a dense #RB# fog lay low upon the great city.\r\n#VBN# clouds drooped sadly over the #JJ# streets.  Down the\r\nStrand the lamps were but misty #NNS# of diffused light which threw\r\na feeble circular glimmer upon the #JJ# pavement.  The yellow glare\r\nfrom the #NN# #VBD# out into the #NN#, #NNS# air, and\r\nthrew a #JJ#, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare.\r\nThere was, to my mind, something #JJ# and #NN# in the endless\r\nprocession of faces which flitted across these narrow #NNS# of\r\nlight,#NN# faces and glad, haggard and merry.  Like all human kind,\r\nthey flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom\r\nonce more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy\r\nevening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined\r\nto make me nervous and depressed.  I could see from Miss Morstan's\r\nmanner that she was suffering from the same feeling.  Holmes alone\r\ncould rise superior to petty #NNS#.  He held his open note-book\r\nupon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and\r\n#NNS# in the light of his #NN#.",
    "At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the\r\n#NN#.  In front a continuous stream of #NN# and\r\n#NNS# were rattling up, #VBG# their cargoes of\r\n#VBN# men and #VBN#, #NN# women.  We had hardly\r\nreached the third pillar, which was our #NNS#, before a small,\r\ndark, brisk man in the dress of a #NN# #VBN# us.",
    "\"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked.",
    "\"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she.",
    "He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.\r\n\"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but\r\nI was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions\r\nis a #NN#.\"",
    "\"I give you my word on that,\" she answered.",
    "He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street #NNP# led across a\r\nfour-wheeler and opened the door.  The man who had addressed us mounted\r\nto the box, while we took our places inside.  We had hardly done so\r\nbefore the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a\r\nfurious pace through the foggy streets.",
    "The situation was a curious one.  We were driving to an unknown place,\r\non an unknown errand.  Yet our invitation was either a complete\r\n#NN#,#NN# was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good\r\nreason to think that important #NNS# might hang upon our journey.\r\nMiss Morstan's #NN# was as resolute and collected as ever.  I\r\n#VBD# to cheer and amuse her by #NNS# of my adventures in\r\n#NNP#; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our\r\nsituation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were\r\nslightly involved.  To this day she declares that I told her one moving\r\nanecdote as to how a #NN# looked into my tent at the dead of night,\r\nand how I fired a #VBN# tiger #NN# at it.  At first I had\r\nsome idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what\r\nwith our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost\r\nmy bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very\r\nlong way.  Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered\r\nthe names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by #JJ#\r\n#NN#.",
    "\"#NNP# #NNP#,\" said he.  \"Now #NNP# Square.  Now we come out on the\r\n#NNP# Bridge Road.  We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.\r\nYes, I thought so.  Now we are on the bridge.  You can catch glimpses\r\nof the river.\"",
    "We did indeed get a #JJ# view of a stretch of the Thames with the\r\nlamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and\r\nwas soon involved in a #NN# of streets upon the other side.",
    "\"#NNP# Road,\" said my companion.  \"#NNP# Road.  #NNP# Hall Lane.\r\n#NN# Place.  #NNP# Street.  #NNP# #NNP# Lane.  Our quest does not\r\nappear to take us to very #JJ# regions.\"",
    "We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood.\r\nLong lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare\r\nand #JJ# #NN# of public houses at the corner.  Then came rows\r\nof #VBN# #NNS# each with a fronting of #JJ# garden, and\r\nthen again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the\r\nmonster #NNS# which the giant city was throwing out into the\r\ncountry.  At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace.\r\nNone of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped\r\nwas as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen\r\nwindow.  On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open\r\nby a #NNP# servant clad in a yellow turban, white #VBG#\r\nclothes, and a yellow #NN#.  There was something strangely #JJ#\r\nin this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a\r\nthird-rate #JJ# #NN#.",
    "\"The #NN# awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high\r\n#VBG# voice from some inner room.  \"Show them in to me, #NN#,\"\r\nit cried.  \"Show them straight in to me.\"",
    "The #NNP# of the #VBN# Man",
    "We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and\r\nworse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw\r\nopen.  A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre\r\nof the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle\r\nof red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining #NN# which\r\nshot out from among it like a #NN# from #NNS#.  He writhed\r\nhis hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual\r\njerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in #NN#.\r\nNature had given him a #NNS# lip, and a too visible line of yellow\r\nand irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly\r\npassing his hand over the lower part of his face.  In spite of his\r\nobtrusive #NN#, he gave the impression of youth.  In point of fact\r\nhe had just turned his #JJ# year.",
    "\"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice.\r\n\"Your servant, gentlemen.  Pray step into my little sanctum.  A small\r\nplace, miss, but furnished to my own #VBG#. An oasis of art in the\r\nhowling desert of South London.\"",
    "We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he\r\ninvited us.  In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond\r\nof the first water in a setting of brass.  The richest and #NN# of\r\ncurtains and #NNS# draped the walls, #VBD# back here and there to\r\nexpose some #VBN# painting or Oriental vase.  The carpet was\r\nof #NN#, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly\r\ninto it, as into a bed of #NN#.  Two great #NN# thrown #NN#\r\nit increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge #NN#\r\nwhich stood upon a mat in the corner.  A lamp in the fashion of a\r\nsilver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre\r\nof the room.  As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and #JJ#\r\nodor.",
    "\"Mr. #NNP# Sholto,\" said the little man, still jerking and smiling.\r\n\"That is my name.  You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these\r\n#NN#\"",
    "\"This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\"",
    "\"A doctor, eh?\" cried he, much excited.  \"Have you your #NN#?\r\nMight I ask #NN# you have the kindness?  I have grave doubts as\r\nto my #JJ# #NN#, if you would be so very good.  The #NN# I may\r\nrely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\"",
    "I listened to his heart, as #VBD#, but was unable to find anything\r\namiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered\r\nfrom head to foot.  \"It appears to be normal,\" I said.  \"You have no\r\ncause for uneasiness.\"",
    "\"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remarked, #RB#. \"I am\r\na great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve.  I\r\nam delighted to hear that they are #JJ#.  Had your father, Miss\r\nMorstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have\r\nbeen alive now.\"",
    "I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this\r\n#JJ# and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter.  Miss Morstan\r\nsat down, and her face grew white to the lips.  \"I knew in my heart\r\nthat he was dead,\" said she.",
    "\"I can give you every information,\" said he, \"and, what is more, I can\r\ndo you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother #NN# may say.\r\nI am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you,\r\nbut also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say.  The three of\r\nus can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew.  But let us have no\r\n#NNS#,#NN# police or officials.  We can settle everything\r\n#RB# among ourselves, without any interference.  Nothing\r\nwould #VB# Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\"  He sat down\r\nupon a low settee and blinked at us #RB# with his weak, watery\r\nblue eyes.",
    "\"For my part,\" said Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no\r\nfurther.\"",
    "I nodded to show my agreement.",
    "\"That is well!  That is well!\" said he.  \"May I offer you a glass of\r\n#NN#, Miss Morstan?  Or of Tokay?  I keep no other wines. Shall I\r\nopen a #NN#?  No?  Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to\r\n#NN#, to the mild #NN# odor of the Eastern tobacco.  I am\r\na little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable #NN#.\"  He\r\napplied a #NN# to the great bowl, and the smoke #VBN# #RB#\r\nthrough the #NN#.  We sat all three in a semicircle, with our\r\nheads advanced, and our #NNS# upon our hands, while the strange, jerky\r\nlittle fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed #RB# in the\r\ncentre.",
    "\"When I first determined to make this communication to you,\" said he,\r\n\"I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might\r\ndisregard my #NN# and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the\r\nliberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man\r\nWilliams might be able to see you first.  I have complete confidence in\r\nhis discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed\r\nno further in the matter.  You will excuse these precautions, but I am\r\na man of somewhat #VBG#, and I might even say refined, #NNS#, and\r\nthere is nothing more #NN# than a policeman.  I have a natural\r\nshrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact\r\nwith the rough crowd.  I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere\r\nof elegance around me.  I may call myself a #NN# of the #NNS#.  It is\r\nmy weakness.  The landscape is a genuine #NNP#, and, though a\r\n#NN# might perhaps throw a doubt upon that #NN# #NNP#, there\r\ncannot be the least question about the #NN#.  I am #JJ# to the\r\nmodern French school.\"",
    "\"You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\" said Miss Morstan, \"but I am here at\r\nyour request to learn something which you desire to tell me.  It is\r\nvery late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as\r\npossible.\"",
    "\"At the best it must take some time,\" he answered; \"for we shall\r\ncertainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew.  We shall\r\nall go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew.  He is\r\nvery angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.\r\nI had quite high words with him last night.  You cannot imagine what a\r\nterrible fellow he is when he is angry.\"",
    "\"If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at\r\nonce,\" I ventured to remark.",
    "He laughed until his ears were quite red.  \"That would hardly do,\" he\r\ncried.  \"I don't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden\r\nway.  No, I must #VB# you by showing you how we all stand to each\r\nother. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several\r\npoints in the story of which I am myself ignorant.  I can only lay the\r\nfacts before you as far as I know them myself.",
    "\"My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the\r\nIndian army.  He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at\r\n#NN# Lodge in Upper Norwood.  He had #VBN# in India, and\r\nbrought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection\r\nof valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants.  With these\r\n#NNS# he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury.  My\r\n#NN# Bartholomew and I were the only children.",
    "\"I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the\r\ndisappearance of Captain Morstan.  We read the details in the papers,\r\nand, knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussed\r\nthe case freely in his presence.  He used to join in our speculations\r\nas to what could have happened.  Never for an instant did we suspect\r\nthat he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of all men\r\nhe alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.",
    "\"We did know, however, that some #NN# positive\r\n#NN# our father.  He was very fearful of going out alone,\r\nand he always employed two #NNS# to act as #NNS# at\r\nPondicherry Lodge.  Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them.\r\nHe was once #JJ# champion of England.  Our father would never\r\ntell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men\r\nwith wooden legs.  On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a\r\n#VBN# man, who proved to be a harmless #NN# #VBG# for\r\norders.  We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up.  My brother\r\nand I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have\r\nsince led us to change our opinion.",
    "\"Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great\r\nshock to him.  He nearly fainted at the #NN# when he opened\r\nit, and from that day he #VBN# to his death. What was in the letter\r\nwe could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was\r\nshort and written in a #VBG# hand. He had suffered for years from\r\nan #VBN# #NN#, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the\r\nend of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he\r\nwished to make a last communication to us.",
    "\"When we entered his room he was propped up with #NNS# and breathing\r\nheavily.  He #NN# us to lock the door and to come upon either side\r\nof the bed.  Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement\r\nto us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain.  I\r\nshall try and give it to you in his own very words.",
    "\"'I have only one thing,' he said, 'which weighs upon my mind at this\r\nsupreme moment.  It is my treatment of poor Morstan's #JJ#.  The\r\n#VBN# #VBN# which has been my #VBG# #NN# through life has #VBN#\r\nfrom her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers.\r\nAnd yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind and foolish a thing\r\nis #NN#.  The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that\r\nI could not bear to share it with another.  See that #NN# dipped\r\nwith pearls beside the #NN#.  Even that I could not bear to\r\npart with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to\r\nher. You, my #NNS#, will give her a fair share of the #NN# treasure. But\r\nsend her #NN# even the #NN# I am gone. After all, men\r\nhave been as bad as this and have recovered.",
    "\"'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he continued.  'He had suffered\r\nfor years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one.  I\r\nalone knew it.  When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of\r\ncircumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure.  I\r\nbrought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he\r\ncame straight over here to claim his share.  He walked over from the\r\nstation, and was admitted by my faithful #JJ# #NN#, who is now dead.\r\nMorstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the\r\ntreasure, and we came to heated words.  Morstan had sprung out of his\r\nchair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his\r\nside, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his\r\nhead against the corner of the #NN#.  When I stooped over him\r\nI found, to my horror, that he was dead.",
    "\"'For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do.\r\nMy first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could\r\nnot but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused\r\nof his murder.  His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in\r\nhis head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could\r\nnot be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I\r\nwas particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul\r\nupon earth knew where he had gone.  There seemed to be no necessity why\r\nany soul ever should know.",
    "\"'I was still #VBG# over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my\r\nservant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway.  He stole in and bolted the door\r\nbehind him.  \"Do not fear, Sahib,\" he said.  \"No one need know that you\r\nhave killed him.  Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\" \"I did\r\nnot kill him,\" said I.  Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled.  \"I\r\nheard it all, Sahib,\" said he.  \"I heard you quarrel, and I heard the\r\nblow.  But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house.  Let us put\r\nhim away together.\" That was enough to decide me.  If my own servant\r\ncould not believe my #NN#, how could I hope to make it good before\r\ntwelve foolish #NNS# in a #NN#?  Lal Chowdar and I disposed of\r\nthe body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full\r\nof the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.  You will see from\r\nwhat I say that I can hardly be #VBD# in the matter.  My fault lies in\r\nthe fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure,\r\nand that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own.  I wish\r\nyou, therefore, to make #NN#.  Put your ears down to my mouth.\r\nThe treasure is hidden #NN#'  At this instant a horrible change came\r\nover his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he\r\nyelled, in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out!  For\r\n#NNP#'s sake keep him out!'  We both stared round at the window behind\r\nus upon which his gaze was fixed.  A face was looking in at us out of\r\nthe darkness.  We could see the whitening of the nose where it was\r\npressed against the glass.  It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild\r\ncruel eyes and an expression of concentrated #NN#. My brother\r\nand I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone.  When we\r\nreturned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to\r\nbeat.",
    "\"We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the #NN#,\r\nsave that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the\r\n#VBN#.  But for that one trace, we might have thought that our\r\nimaginations had #VBN# up that wild, fierce face.  We soon, however,\r\nhad another and a more striking proof that there were secret #NNS#\r\nat work all round us.  The window of my father's room was found open in\r\nthe morning, his #NNS# and boxes had been #JJ#, and upon his\r\nchest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words 'The sign of the\r\nfour' scrawled across it.  What the phrase meant, or who our secret\r\nvisitor may have been, we never knew.  As far as we can judge, none of\r\nmy father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had\r\nbeen turned out.  My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar\r\nincident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it\r\nis still a complete mystery to us.\"",
    "The little man stopped to #NN# his hookah and puffed thoughtfully\r\nfor a few moments.  We had all sat absorbed, listening to his\r\nextraordinary narrative.  At the short account of her father's death\r\nMiss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that\r\nshe was about to faint.  She rallied however, on drinking a glass of\r\nwater which I quietly poured out for her from a #NNP# #NN# upon\r\nthe #NN#.  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an\r\nabstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.\r\nAs I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had\r\n#VBD# bitterly of the #NN# of life.  Here at least was\r\na problem which would #VB# his #NN# to the utmost.  Mr. Thaddeus\r\nSholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the\r\neffect which his story had produced, and then continued between the\r\n#VBZ# of his #VBN# pipe.",
    "\"My brother and I,\" said he, \"were, as you may imagine, much excited as\r\nto the treasure which my father had spoken of.  For weeks and for\r\nmonths we dug and #VBN# in every part of the garden, without\r\ndiscovering its whereabouts.  It was #JJ# to think that the\r\nhiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died.  We could\r\njudge the #NN# of the missing #NNS# by the chaplet which he had\r\ntaken out.  Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some\r\nlittle discussion.  The pearls were evidently of great value, and he\r\nwas averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was\r\nhimself a little inclined to my father's fault.  He thought, too, that\r\nif we #VBD# with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally\r\nbring us into trouble.  It was all that I could do to persuade him to\r\nlet me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at\r\nfixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel #JJ#.\"",
    "\"It was a kindly thought,\" said our companion, earnestly.  \"It was\r\nextremely good of you.\"",
    "The little man waved his hand #RB#.  \"We were your #NNS#,\"\r\nhe said.  \"That was the view which I took of it, though Brother\r\nBartholomew could not altogether see it in that light.  We had plenty\r\nof money ourselves.  I desired no more. Besides, it would have been\r\nsuch bad taste to have treated a young lady in so #NN# a fashion. 'Le\r\n#NNS# #NN# #NN# au crime.'  The French have a very neat way of\r\nputting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so\r\nfar that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself:  so I left\r\nPondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.\r\nYesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has\r\noccurred.  The treasure has been discovered.  I instantly communicated\r\nwith Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood\r\nand demand our share.  I explained my views last night to Brother\r\nBartholomew:  so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\"",
    "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.\r\nWe all #VBN# silent, with our thoughts upon the new development\r\nwhich the mysterious business had taken.  Holmes was the first to\r\nspring to his feet.",
    "\"You have done well, sir, from first to last,\" said he.  \"It is\r\npossible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing\r\nsome light upon that which is still dark to you.  But, as Miss Morstan\r\nremarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through\r\nwithout delay.\"",
    "Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his\r\nhookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long #VBN#\r\n#NN# with #NN# collar and #NNS#.  This he buttoned tightly up,\r\nin spite of the extreme #NN# of the night, and finished his attire\r\nby putting on a #NN# cap with hanging #NNS# which covered the\r\nears, so that no part of him was visible save his #JJ# and #JJ#\r\nface.  \"My health is somewhat #JJ#,\" he remarked, as he led the way\r\ndown the passage.  \"I am compelled to be a #NN#.\"",
    "Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our #NN# was evidently\r\nprearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.\r\nThaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above\r\nthe rattle of the wheels.",
    "\"Bartholomew is a clever fellow,\" said he.  \"How do you think he found\r\nout where the treasure was?  He had come to the conclusion that it was\r\nsomewhere indoors:  so he worked out all the #JJ# space of the house,\r\nand made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be\r\n#JJ# for.  Among other things, he found that the height of the\r\nbuilding was #NN# feet, but on adding together the heights of\r\nall the separate rooms, and making every #NN# for the space\r\nbetween, which he ascertained by #NNS#, he could not bring the total\r\nto more than #NN# feet. There were four feet unaccounted for.  These\r\ncould only be at the top of the building.  He knocked a hole,\r\ntherefore, in the #NN# ceiling of the highest room, and\r\nthere, sure enough, he came upon another little #NN# above it, which\r\nhad been sealed up and was known to no one.  In the centre stood the\r\ntreasure-chest, resting upon two #NNS#.  He #VBD# it through the\r\nhole, and there it lies.  He #VBZ# the value of the jewels at not\r\nless than half a million #VBG#.\"",
    "At the mention of this gigantic sum we all #VBN# at one another\r\n#VBN#.  Miss Morstan, could we secure her #NNS#, would change from\r\na #JJ# governess to the richest #NN# in England. Surely it was the\r\nplace of a #JJ# friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to\r\nsay that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as\r\nheavy as lead within me.  I stammered out some few halting words of\r\ncongratulation, and then sat #JJ#, with my head drooped, deaf to\r\nthe #NN# of our new acquaintance.  He was clearly a confirmed\r\n#NN#, and I was #RB# conscious that he was pouring forth\r\ninterminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the\r\ncomposition and action of innumerable quack #NNS#, some of which he\r\nbore about in a leather case in his pocket.  I trust that he may not\r\nremember any of the answers which I gave him that night.  Holmes\r\ndeclares that he #VBN# me caution him against the great danger of\r\ntaking more than two drops of #NN# oil, while I recommended\r\n#NN# in large #NNS# as a sedative. However that may be, I was\r\ncertainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman\r\nsprang down to open the door.",
    "\"This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\" said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\r\nas he handed her out.",
    "The #NN# of Pondicherry Lodge",
    "It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our\r\nnight's adventures.  We had left the damp fog of the great city behind\r\nus, and the night was fairly fine.  A warm wind blew from the westward,\r\nand heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping\r\noccasionally through the #NNS#.  It was clear enough to see for some\r\ndistance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the #NN# from the\r\ncarriage to give us a better light upon our way.",
    "Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own #NNS#, and was girt round with a\r\nvery high stone wall topped with broken glass.  A single narrow\r\n#VBN# door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide\r\nknocked with a peculiar #NN# #NN#.",
    "\"Who is there?\" cried a gruff voice from within.",
    "\"It is I, #NN#.  You surely know my knock by this time.\"",
    "There was a grumbling sound and a #VBG# and #VBG# of keys. The\r\ndoor swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the\r\nopening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his\r\nprotruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.",
    "\"That you, Mr. Thaddeus?  But who are the others?  I had no orders\r\nabout them from the master.\"",
    "\"No, McMurdo?  You surprise me!  I told my brother last night that I\r\nshould bring some friends.\"",
    "\"He ain't been out o' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no\r\norders.  You know very well that I must stick to #NNS#. I can let\r\nyou in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\"",
    "This was an unexpected obstacle.  Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a\r\nperplexed and helpless manner.  \"This is too bad of you, McMurdo!\" he\r\nsaid.  \"If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young\r\nlady, too.  She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\"",
    "\"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\" said the porter, #RB#.  \"Folk may be\r\nfriends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's.  He pays me well\r\nto do my duty, and my duty I'll do.  I don't know none o' your friends.\"",
    "\"Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,\" cried Sherlock Holmes, #RB#.  \"I don't\r\nthink you can have forgotten me.  Don't you remember the amateur who\r\nfought three rounds with you at #NN#'s rooms on the night of your\r\nbenefit four years back?\"",
    "\"Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" roared the #NN#.  \"God's truth! how\r\ncould I #UH#ve mistook you?  If instead o' #NN#' there so quiet you\r\nhad just stepped up and given me that #NN# of yours under the jaw,\r\nI'd ha' known you without a question. Ah, you're one that has wasted\r\nyour gifts, you have!  You might have aimed high, if you had joined the\r\nfancy.\"",
    "\"You see, Watson, if all else #VBZ# me I have still one of the\r\nscientific professions open to me,\" said Holmes, laughing.  \"Our friend\r\nwon't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\"",
    "\"In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends,\" he answered.\r\n\"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be\r\ncertain of your friends before I let them in.\"",
    "Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of\r\na house, square and prosaic, all #VBN# in shadow save where a\r\n#NN# struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window.  The vast\r\nsize of the building, with its gloom and its #RB# silence, struck a\r\nchill to the heart.  Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the\r\nlantern quivered and rattled in his hand.",
    "\"I cannot understand it,\" he said.  \"There must be some mistake. I\r\ndistinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no\r\nlight in his window.  I do not know what to make of it.\"",
    "\"Does he always guard the premises in this way?\" asked Holmes.",
    "\"Yes; he has followed my father's custom.  He was the favorite son, you\r\nknow, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than\r\nhe ever told me.  That is Bartholomew's window up there where the\r\nmoonshine strikes.  It is quite bright, but there is no light from\r\nwithin, I think.\"",
    "\"None,\" said Holmes.  \"But I see the glint of a light in that little\r\nwindow beside the door.\"",
    "\"Ah, that is the housekeeper's room.  That is where old Mrs. #NN#\r\n#VBZ#.  She can tell us all about it.  But perhaps you would not mind\r\nwaiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she\r\nhas no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\"",
    "He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light\r\nflickered and wavered all round us.  Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and\r\nwe all stood with #VBG# hearts, straining our ears. From the great\r\nblack house there sounded through the silent night the #NN# and most\r\npitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken #VBG# of a frightened woman.",
    "\"It is Mrs. Bernstone,\" said Sholto.  \"She is the only woman in the\r\nhouse.  Wait here.  I shall be back in a moment.\"  He hurried for the\r\ndoor, and knocked in his peculiar way.  We could see a tall old woman\r\nadmit him, and #VB# with pleasure at the very sight of him.",
    "\"Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come!  I am so glad you\r\nhave come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\"  We heard her #VBD# #NNS#\r\nuntil the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled\r\nmonotone.",
    "Our guide had left us the lantern.  Holmes swung it slowly round, and\r\npeered #RB# at the house, and at the great #NN# which\r\n#VBN# the grounds.  Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand\r\nwas in mine.  A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who\r\nhad never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even\r\nlook of #NN# had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble\r\nour hands #RB# sought for each other.  I have marvelled at it\r\nsince, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should\r\ngo out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also\r\nthe instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection.  So we stood\r\nhand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for\r\nall the dark things that surrounded us.",
    "\"What a strange place!\" she said, looking round.",
    "\"It looks as though all the #NNS# in England had been let loose in it.\r\nI have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near #NN#,\r\nwhere the #NN# had been at work.\"",
    "\"And from the same cause,\" said Holmes.  \"These are the traces of the\r\n#NN#.  You must remember that they were six years looking\r\nfor it.  No wonder that the grounds look like a #NN#.\"",
    "At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto\r\ncame running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.",
    "\"There is something amiss with Bartholomew!\" he cried.  \"I am\r\nfrightened!  My nerves cannot stand it.\"  He was, indeed, half\r\n#VBG# with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from\r\nthe great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a\r\nterrified child.",
    "\"Come into the house,\" said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.",
    "\"Yes, do!\" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto.  \"I really do not feel equal to\r\ngiving directions.\"",
    "We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the\r\nleft-hand side of the passage.  The old woman was pacing up and down\r\nwith a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss\r\nMorstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.",
    "\"God bless your sweet calm face!\" she cried, with an hysterical sob.\r\n\"It does me good to see you.  Oh, but I have been sorely tried this\r\nday!\"",
    "Our companion patted her thin, #NN# hand, and murmured some few\r\nwords of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the\r\nothers #JJ# cheeks.",
    "\"#NNP# has locked himself in and will not answer me,\" she explained.\r\n\"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often #VBZ# to be\r\nalone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up\r\nand peeped through the key-hole.  You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,--you\r\nmust go up and look for yourself.  I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto\r\nin joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such\r\na face on him as that.\"",
    "Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's\r\nteeth were chattering in his head.  So shaken was he that I had to pass\r\nmy hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were\r\ntrembling under him.  Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out\r\nof his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be\r\nmere #JJ# #NN# of dust upon the #NN# matting which served\r\nas a #NN#. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the\r\nlamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left.  Miss Morstan had\r\nremained behind with the frightened housekeeper.",
    "The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length,\r\nwith a great picture in Indian #NN# upon the right of it and three\r\ndoors upon the left.  Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and\r\nmethodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black\r\nshadows streaming backwards down the corridor.  The third door was that\r\nwhich we were seeking.  Holmes knocked without receiving any answer,\r\nand then tried to turn the handle and force it open.  It was locked on\r\nthe inside, however, and by a broad and powerful #NN#, as we could see\r\nwhen we set our lamp up against it.  The key being turned, however, the\r\nhole was not entirely closed.  Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and\r\ninstantly rose again with a sharp #VBG# of the breath.",
    "\"There is something devilish in this, Watson,\" said he, more moved than\r\nI had ever before seen him.  \"What do you make of it?\"",
    "I stooped to the hole, and #VBD# in horror.  #NN# was streaming\r\ninto the room, and it was bright with a vague and #JJ# radiance.\r\nLooking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all\r\nbeneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face of our\r\ncompanion Thaddeus.  There was the same high, shining head, the same\r\ncircular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.  The\r\nfeatures were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural\r\ngrin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the\r\nnerves than any #NN# or contortion.  So like was the face to that of\r\nour little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was\r\nindeed with us.  Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us\r\nthat his brother and he were #NNS#.",
    "\"This is terrible!\" I said to Holmes.  \"What is to be done?\"",
    "\"The door must come down,\" he answered, and, springing against it, he\r\nput all his weight upon the lock.  It creaked and groaned, but did not\r\nyield.  Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it\r\ngave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew\r\nSholto's chamber.",
    "It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory.  A double\r\nline of #VBN# bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the\r\ndoor, and the table was littered over with #NN# #NNS#, #NN#,\r\nand #NNS#.  In the #NNS# stood #NNS# of acid in #NN# #NNS#.\r\nOne of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of\r\n#VBN# liquid had #VBN# out from it, and the air was heavy\r\nwith a peculiarly #JJ#, #NN# odor.  A set of steps stood at one\r\nside of the room, in the midst of a litter of #NN# and plaster, and\r\nabove them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man\r\nto pass through.  At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was\r\nthrown carelessly together.",
    "By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated\r\nall in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that\r\nghastly, #JJ# smile upon his face.  He was stiff and cold, and\r\nhad clearly been dead many hours.  It seemed to me that not only his\r\nfeatures but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most\r\nfantastic fashion.  By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar\r\ninstrument,--a brown, #VBN# stick, with a stone head like a\r\nhammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine.  Beside it was a torn sheet\r\nof #NN# with some words scrawled upon it.  Holmes glanced at it,\r\nand then handed it to me.",
    "\"You see,\" he said, with a #JJ# raising of the eyebrows.",
    "In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \"The sign\r\nof the four.\"",
    "\"In God's name, what does it all #NN#?\" I asked.",
    "\"It means murder,\" said he, stooping over the dead man.  \"Ah, I\r\nexpected it.  Look here!\"  He pointed to what looked like a long, dark\r\nthorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.",
    "\"It looks like a thorn,\" said I.",
    "\"It is a thorn.  You may pick it out.  But be careful, for it is\r\npoisoned.\"",
    "I took it up between my finger and thumb.  It came away from the skin\r\nso readily that hardly any mark was left behind.  One tiny speck of\r\nblood showed where the #NN# had been.",
    "\"This is all an #JJ# mystery to me,\" said I.  \"It grows darker\r\ninstead of clearer.\"",
    "\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it #VBZ# every instant.  I only\r\nrequire a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\"",
    "We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the\r\nchamber.  He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of\r\nterror, wringing his hands and #VBG# to himself. Suddenly, however,\r\nhe broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.",
    "\"The treasure is gone!\" he said.  \"They have robbed him of the\r\ntreasure!  There is the hole through which we lowered it.  I helped him\r\nto do it!  I was the last person who saw him!  I left him here last\r\nnight, and I heard him lock the door as I came #NN#.\"",
    "\"What time was that?\"",
    "\"It was ten o'clock.  And now he is dead, and the police will be called\r\nin, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am\r\nsure I shall.  But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you don't\r\nthink that it was I?  Is it likely that I would have brought you here\r\nif it were I?  Oh, dear! oh, dear!  I know that I shall go mad!\"  He\r\njerked his arms and #VBN# his feet in a kind of #JJ# frenzy.",
    "\"You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes, kindly, putting\r\nhis hand upon his shoulder.  \"Take my advice, and drive down to the\r\nstation to report this matter to the police.  #VB# to assist them in\r\nevery way.  We shall wait here until your return.\"",
    "The little man #VBD# in a #VBN# fashion, and we heard him\r\nstumbling down the stairs in the dark.",
    "Sherlock Holmes #VBZ# a #NN#",
    "\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \"we have half an hour to\r\nourselves.  Let us make good use of it.  My case is, as I have told\r\nyou, almost complete; but we must not #VBP# on the side of\r\n#NN#.  Simple as the case seems now, there may be something\r\ndeeper underlying it.\"",
    "\"Simple!\" I #VBD#.",
    "\"Surely,\" said he, with something of the air of a #JJ# professor\r\n#VBG# to his class.  \"Just sit in the corner there, that your\r\n#NNS# may not #VB# matters.  Now to work!  In the first\r\nplace, how did these folk come, and how did they go?  The door has not\r\nbeen opened since last night.  How of the window?\"  He carried the lamp\r\nacross to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but\r\naddressing them to himself rather than to me.  \"#NN# is #VBN# on\r\nthe inner side. #NNP# is solid.  No #NNS# at the side.  Let us\r\nopen it.  No #NN# near.  #NNP# quite out of reach.  Yet a man has\r\nmounted by the window. It rained a little last night.  Here is the\r\nprint of a foot in mould upon the #NN#.  And here is a circular muddy\r\nmark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See\r\nhere, Watson!  This is really a very pretty demonstration.\"",
    "I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs.  \"This is not a\r\nfootmark,\" said I.",
    "\"It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a\r\nwooden stump.  You see here on the sill is the #NN#, a heavy boot\r\nwith the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the #NN#.\"",
    "\"It is the wooden-legged man.\"",
    "\"Quite so.  But there has been some one else,--a very able and\r\nefficient ally.  Could you scale that wall, doctor?\"",
    "I looked out of the open window.  The moon still shone brightly on that\r\nangle of the house.  We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and,\r\nlook where I would, I could see no #NN#, nor as much as a #NN#\r\nin the #NN#.",
    "\"It is absolutely impossible,\" I answered.",
    "\"Without aid it is so.  But suppose you had a friend up here who\r\nlowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing\r\none end of it to this great #NN# in the wall.  Then, I think, if you\r\nwere an active man, You might #NN# up, wooden leg and all.  You would\r\ndepart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the\r\nrope, #VB# it from the hook, shut the window, #NN# it on the inside,\r\nand get away in the way that he originally came.  As a minor point it\r\nmay be noted,\" he continued, fingering the rope, \"that our\r\nwooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional\r\nsailor.  His hands were far from #NN#.  My lens #VBZ# more than\r\none #NN#, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I\r\ngather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin\r\noff his hand.\"",
    "\"This is all very well,\" said I, \"but the thing becomes more\r\nunintelligible than ever.  How about this mysterious ally?  How came he\r\ninto the room?\"",
    "\"Yes, the ally!\" repeated Holmes, pensively.  \"There are features of\r\ninterest about this ally.  He #VBZ# the case from the regions of the\r\ncommonplace.  I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals\r\nof crime in this country,#NN# parallel cases suggest themselves\r\nfrom India, and, if my memory serves me, from #NN#.\"",
    "\"How came he, then?\"  I reiterated.  \"The door is locked, the window is\r\ninaccessible.  Was it through the chimney?\"",
    "\"The grate is much too small,\" he answered.  \"I had already considered\r\nthat possibility.\"",
    "\"How then?\" I persisted.",
    "\"You will not apply my #NN#,\" he said, shaking his head.  \"How often\r\nhave I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible\r\nwhatever remains, #RB# #JJ#, must be the truth?  We know that\r\nhe did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney.  We also\r\nknow that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no\r\nconcealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\"",
    "\"He came through the hole in the roof,\" I cried.",
    "\"Of course he did.  He must have done so. If you will have the kindness\r\nto hold the lamp for me, we shall now #VB# our researches to the room\r\nabove,--the secret room in which the treasure was found.\"",
    "He mounted the steps, and, seizing a #NN# with either hand, he swung\r\nhimself up into the garret.  Then, lying on his face, he reached down\r\nfor the lamp and held it while I followed him.",
    "The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and\r\nsix the other.  The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin\r\nlath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from #NN#\r\nto beam.  The roof ran up to an #NN#, and was evidently the inner #NN#\r\nof the true roof of the house.  There was no furniture of any sort, and\r\nthe #VBN# dust of years lay thick upon the floor.",
    "\"Here you are, you see,\" said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against\r\nthe sloping wall.  \"This is a #NN# which #VBZ# out on to the roof.\r\nI can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle\r\nangle.  This, then, is the way by which #NN# One entered.  Let us see\r\nif we can find any other traces of his individuality.\"",
    "He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the\r\nsecond time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.\r\nFor myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.\r\nThe floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,#NN#,\r\nwell defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an\r\nordinary man.",
    "\"Holmes,\" I said, in a whisper, \"a child has done the horrid thing.\"",
    "He had recovered his #NN# in an instant.  \"I was staggered\r\nfor the moment,\" he said, \"but the thing is quite natural.  My memory\r\nfailed me, or I should have been able to #VB# it.  There is nothing\r\nmore to be learned here.  Let us go down.\"",
    "\"What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\" I asked, eagerly,\r\nwhen we had regained the lower room once more.",
    "\"My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\" said he, with a touch\r\nof impatience.  \"You know my methods.  #RB# them, and it will be\r\ninstructive to compare results.\"",
    "\"I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\" I answered.",
    "\"It will be clear enough to you soon,\" he said, in an off-hand way.  \"I\r\nthink that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\"\r\nHe whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room\r\non his knees, #VBG#, #VBG#, examining, with his long thin nose\r\nonly a few inches from the #NNS#, and his beady eyes gleaming and\r\ndeep-set like those of a bird.  So swift, silent, and furtive were his\r\nmovements, like those of a trained #NN# picking out a scent,\r\nthat I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made\r\nhad he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of\r\n#VBG# them in its defense.  As he hunted about, he kept muttering to\r\nhimself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.",
    "\"We are certainly in luck,\" said he.  \"We ought to have very little\r\ntrouble now.  Number One has had the misfortune to #VB# in the\r\n#NN#.  You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here\r\nat the side of this #VBG# #NN#.  The #NN# has been cracked,\r\nYou see, and the stuff has #VBN# out.\"",
    "\"What then?\" I asked.",
    "\"Why, we have got him, that's all,\" said he.  \"I know a dog that would\r\nfollow that scent to the world's end.  If a pack can track a #VBN#\r\n#VBG# across a #NN#, how far can a #JJ# hound follow so\r\npungent a smell as this?  It sounds like a sum in the rule of three.\r\nThe answer should give us #NN# #NN#! here are the #NN#\r\nrepresentatives of the law.\"",
    "#NNP# steps and the #NN# of loud voices were #JJ# from below, and\r\nthe hall door shut with a loud crash.",
    "\"Before they come,\" said Holmes, \"just put your hand here on this poor\r\nfellow's arm, and here on his leg.  What do you feel?\"",
    "\"The muscles are as hard as a board,\" I answered.",
    "\"Quite so.  They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding\r\nthe usual rigor mortis.  #VBN# with this distortion of the face, this\r\n#NN# smile, or '#NN# #NN#,' as the old #NNS# called it,\r\nwhat conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\"",
    "\"Death from some powerful vegetable #NN#,\" I answered,--\"some\r\n#NN# substance which would produce #NNS#.\"",
    "\"That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn\r\nmuscles of the face.  On getting into the room I at once looked for the\r\nmeans by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I\r\ndiscovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force\r\ninto the scalp.  You observe that the part struck was that which would\r\nbe turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his\r\nchair.  Now examine the thorn.\"",
    "I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was\r\nlong, sharp, and black, with a #VBN# look near the point as though\r\nsome #JJ# substance had dried upon it.  The blunt end had been #VBN#\r\nand rounded off with a knife.",
    "\"Is that an English thorn?\" he asked.",
    "\"No, it certainly is not.\"",
    "\"With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.\r\nBut here are the #NNS#:  so the #JJ# forces may beat a retreat.\"",
    "As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on\r\nthe passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily\r\ninto the room.  He was red-faced, burly and #NN#, with a pair of\r\nvery small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen\r\nand puffy #NNS#. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform,\r\nand by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.",
    "\"Here's a business!\" he cried, in a muffled, #JJ# voice. \"Here's a\r\npretty business!  But who are all these?  Why, the house seems to be as\r\nfull as a #NN#!\"",
    "\"I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\" said Holmes,\r\nquietly.",
    "\"Why, of course I do!\" he #VBD#.  \"It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the\r\n#NN#.  Remember you!  I'll never forget how you #VBD# us all on\r\ncauses and inferences and effects in the #NN# #NN# case.  It's\r\ntrue you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was more\r\nby good luck than good guidance.\"",
    "\"It was a piece of very simple reasoning.\"",
    "\"Oh, come, now, come!  Never be ashamed to own up.  But what is all\r\nthis?  #JJ# business!  Bad business!  #NNP# facts here,--no room for\r\ntheories.  How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another\r\ncase!  I was at the station when the message arrived.  What d'you think\r\nthe man died of?\"",
    "\"Oh, this is hardly a case for me to #VBP# over,\" said Holmes, dryly.",
    "\"No, no.  Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head\r\nsometimes.  Dear me!  #NNP# locked, I understand.  #NNS# worth half a\r\nmillion missing.  How was the window?\"",
    "\"#VBN#; but there are steps on the sill.\"",
    "\"Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with\r\nthe matter.  That's common sense.  Man might have died in a fit; but\r\nthen the jewels are missing.  Ha!  I have a theory. These flashes come\r\nupon me at times.#NN# step outside, #NN#, and you, Mr. Sholto.\r\nYour friend can remain.#NN# do you think of this, Holmes?  Sholto\r\nwas, on his own confession, with his brother last night.  The brother\r\ndied in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure.  How's\r\nthat?\"",
    "\"On which the dead man very #RB# got up and locked the door on\r\nthe inside.\"",
    "\"Hum!  There's a #NN# there.  Let us apply common sense to the matter.\r\nThis Thaddeus Sholto WAS with his brother; there WAS a quarrel; so much\r\nwe know.  The brother is dead and the jewels are gone.  So much also we\r\nknow.  No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him.  His bed\r\nhad not been slept in.  Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state\r\nof mind.  His appearance #NN#, not attractive.  You see that I am\r\n#VBG# my #NN# round Thaddeus.  The net begins to close upon him.\"",
    "\"You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\" said Holmes. \"This\r\n#NN# of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned,\r\nwas in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card,\r\ninscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this\r\nrather curious #VBN# instrument.  How does all that fit into\r\nyour theory?\"",
    "\"#VBZ# it in every respect,\" said the fat detective, pompously.\r\n\"House is full of Indian curiosities.  Thaddeus brought this up, and if\r\nthis splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use\r\nof it as any other man.  The card is some #NN#,--a blind, as\r\nlike as not.  The only question is, how did he depart?  Ah, of course,\r\nhere is a hole in the roof.\"  With great activity, considering his\r\nbulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and\r\nimmediately afterwards we heard his #VBG# voice #VBG# that he\r\nhad found the trap-door.",
    "\"He ca#NN# find something,\" remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoul#FW#rs.  \"He\r\nhas occa#NN#onal #NNS# of reason.  #NN# n'y a #FW# #NNP# #NN# si\r\n#NNS# #FW# #NN# #FW# #NN# de l'#FW#!#NN#\"",
    "\"You see!\" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.\r\n\"#NNP# are better than mere theories, after all.  My view of the case\r\nis confirmed.  There is a trap-door #VBG# with the roof, and it\r\nis partly open.\"",
    "\"It was I who opened it.\"",
    "\"Oh, indeed!  You did notice it, then?\"  He seemed a little crestfallen\r\nat the discovery.  \"Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our\r\ngentleman got away.  Inspector!\"",
    "\"Yes, sir,\" from the passage.",
    "\"Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.#NN#. Sholto, it is my duty to #VB#\r\nyou that anything which you may say will be used against you.  I arrest\r\nyou in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your\r\nbrother.\"",
    "\"There, now!  Didn't I tell you!\" cried the poor little man, throwing\r\nout his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.",
    "\"Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes.  \"I think\r\nthat I can engage to clear you of the charge.\"",
    "\"Don't promise too much, Mr. #NN#,#NN#'t promise too much!\"\r\nsnapped the detective.  \"You may find it a harder matter than you\r\nthink.\"",
    "\"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free\r\npresent of the name and description of one of the two people who were\r\nin this room last night.  His name, I have every reason to believe, is\r\n#NNP# Small.  He is a #NN# man, small, active, with his\r\nright leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the\r\ninner side.  His left boot has a coarse, #VBN# sole, with an iron\r\nband round the heel.  He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has\r\nbeen a #NN#.  These few indications may be of some assistance to\r\nyou, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing\r\nfrom the palm of his hand.  The other #NN#\"",
    "\"Ah! the other man--?\" asked Athelney Jones, in a #VBG# voice, but\r\nimpressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the\r\nother's manner.",
    "\"Is a rather curious person,\" said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his\r\nheel.  \"I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair\r\nof them.#NN# word with you, Watson.\"",
    "He led me out to the head of the stair.  \"This unexpected occurrence,\"\r\nhe said, \"has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of\r\nour journey.\"",
    "\"I have just been thinking so,\" I answered.  \"It is not right that Miss\r\nMorstan should remain in this stricken house.\"",
    "\"No.  You must escort her home.  She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\r\nin Lower Camberwell:  so it is not very far.  I will wait for you here\r\nif you will drive out again.  Or perhaps you are too tired?\"",
    "\"By no means.  I don't think I could rest until I know more of this\r\nfantastic business.  I have seen something of the rough side of life,\r\nbut I give you my word that this quick succession of strange #NNS#\r\nto-night has shaken my nerve completely.  I should like, however, to\r\nsee the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\"",
    "\"Your presence will be of great service to me,\" he answered.  \"We shall\r\nwork the case out #RB#, and leave this fellow Jones to #NN#\r\nover any mare'#NN# which he may choose to construct.  When you have\r\ndropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 #NN# Lane, down\r\nnear the water's edge at #NNP#. The third house on the right-hand\r\nside is a #NN#'s: #NNP# is the name.  You will see a #NN#\r\nholding a young #NN# in the window.  #VB# old Sherman up, and tell\r\nhim, with my compliments, that I want #NN# at once.  You will bring\r\nToby back in the cab with you.\"",
    "\"A dog, I suppose.\"",
    "\"Yes,--a queer #NN#, with a most amazing power of scent.  I would\r\nrather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of\r\nLondon.\"",
    "\"I shall bring him, then,\" said I.  \"It is one now.  I ought to be back\r\nbefore three, if I can get a fresh horse.\"",
    "\"And I,\" said Holmes, \"shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone,\r\nand from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, #VBZ# in the\r\nnext garret.  Then I shall study the great Jones's methods and listen\r\nto his not too delicate #NNS#. '#NN# #FW# #NN# #NNS# die #NN#\r\n#NN# was #NN# #NN# #NN#.'  #NNP# is always #JJ#.\"",
    "Chapter VII",
    "The #NN# of the #NN#",
    "The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss\r\nMorstan back to her home.  After the #JJ# fashion of women, she had\r\nborne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker\r\nthan herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the\r\nside of the frightened housekeeper.  In the cab, however, she first\r\nturned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely had\r\nshe been tried by the adventures of the night.  She has told me since\r\nthat she thought me cold and distant upon that journey.  She little\r\nguessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint\r\nwhich held me back.  My #NNS# and my love went out to her, even as\r\nmy hand had in the garden.  I felt that years of the #NNS#\r\nof life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this\r\none day of strange experiences.  Yet there were two thoughts which\r\nsealed the words of affection upon my lips.  She was weak and helpless,\r\nshaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a #NN# to\r\n#NN# love upon her at such a time.  #JJR# still, she was rich.  If\r\nHolmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress.  Was it\r\nfair, was it #JJ#, that a #NN# surgeon should take such\r\nadvantage of an #NN# which chance had brought about?  Might she not\r\nlook upon me as a mere vulgar #NN#?  I could not bear to risk\r\nthat such a thought should cross her mind.  This Agra treasure\r\nintervened like an impassable #NN# between us.",
    "It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The\r\nservants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so\r\ninterested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that\r\nshe had sat up in the hope of her return.  She opened the door herself,\r\na middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly\r\nher arm stole round the other's waist and how #RB# was the voice in\r\nwhich she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid #NN#, but an\r\nhonored friend.  I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly #VBD#\r\nme to step in and tell her our adventures.  I explained, however, the\r\nimportance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any\r\nprogress which we might make with the case.  As we drove away I stole a\r\nglance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the\r\ntwo graceful, clinging figures, the #VBN# door, the hall light\r\nshining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright\r\n#NN#.  It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a\r\ntranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had\r\nabsorbed us.",
    "And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it\r\ngrew.  I #VBN# the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I\r\nrattled on through the silent #NN# streets.  There was the original\r\nproblem:  that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain\r\nMorstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,#NN#\r\nhad had light upon all those events.  They had only led us, however, to\r\na deeper and far more tragic mystery.  The Indian treasure, the curious\r\nplan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's\r\ndeath, the #NN# of the treasure immediately followed by the\r\nmurder of the discoverer, the very singular #NNS# to the\r\ncrime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card,\r\ncorresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed\r\na labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my\r\n#NN# might well despair of ever finding the clue.",
    "Pinchin Lane was a row of #JJ# two-storied brick houses in the lower\r\nquarter of Lambeth.  I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I\r\ncould make my impression.  At last, however, there was the glint of a\r\ncandle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.",
    "\"Go on, you drunken #NN#,\" said the face.  \"If you kick up any more\r\nrow I'll open the kennels and let out #NN# dogs upon you.\"",
    "\"If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for,\" said I.",
    "\"Go on!\" yelled the voice.  \"So help me gracious, I have a #NN# in the\r\nbag, an' I'll drop it on your '#NN# if you don't hook it.\"",
    "\"But I want a dog,\" I cried.",
    "\"I won't be argued with!\" shouted Mr. Sherman.  \"Now stand clear, for\r\nwhen I say 'three,' down goes the wiper.\"",
    "\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes--\" I began, but the words had a most #JJ#\r\neffect, for the window instantly #VBD# down, and within a minute the\r\ndoor was #VBN# and open.  Mr. Sherman was a #JJ#, lean old man,\r\nwith stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and #VBN# glasses.",
    "\"A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\" said he.  \"Step in, sir.\r\nKeep clear of the #NN#; for he #NNS#.  Ah, naughty, naughty, would\r\nyou take a nip at the gentleman?\"  This to a #NN# which thrust its\r\n#NN#cked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage.  \"Don't mind\r\nthat, sir:  it's only a #NN#.  It #NN#'t got no #NNS#, so I gives\r\nit the run o' the room, for it keeps the beetles down.  You must not\r\nmind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm #VBN# at by\r\nthe children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock\r\nme up.  What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\"",
    "\"He wanted a dog of yours.\"",
    "\"Ah! that would be Toby.\"",
    "\"Yes, Toby was the name.\"",
    "\"Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\"  He moved slowly forward with\r\nhis candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round\r\nhim.  In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were\r\nglancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every #NN# and\r\ncorner.  Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn #NNS#,\r\nwho #RB# shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices\r\ndisturbed their slumbers.",
    "Toby proved to be an #RB#, #VBN#, #VBN# creature, half spaniel\r\nand half #NN#, #NN# in color, with a very clumsy #VBG#\r\ngait.  It accepted after some hesitation a lump of #NN# which the old\r\nnaturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it\r\nfollowed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me.\r\nIt had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back\r\nonce more at Pondicherry Lodge.  The #NN# McMurdo had, I\r\nfound, been arrested as an #NN#, and both he and Mr. Sholto had\r\nbeen marched off to the station.  Two #NNS# guarded the narrow\r\ngate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my #VBG# the\r\ndetective's name.",
    "Holmes was standing on the #NN#, with his hands in his pockets,\r\nsmoking his pipe.",
    "\"Ah, you have him there!\" said he.  \"Good dog, then!  #NN# Jones has\r\ngone.  We have had an immense #NN# of energy since you left.  He has\r\narrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the #NN#, the housekeeper,\r\nand the Indian servant.  We have the place to ourselves, but for a\r\nsergeant #NN#.  Leave the dog here, and come up.\"",
    "We tied Toby to the hall table, and #VBN# the stairs.  The room\r\nwas as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the\r\ncentral figure.  A #VBG# #NN# #VBN# in the corner.",
    "\"#VB# me your bull's-eye, sergeant,\" said my companion.  \"Now tie this\r\nbit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.\r\nNow I must kick off my boots and #NNS#.--Just you carry them down\r\nwith you, Watson.  I am going to do a little climbing.  And dip my\r\nhandkerchief into the #NN#.  That will do.  Now come up into the\r\ngarret with me for a moment.\"",
    "We clambered up through the hole.  Holmes turned his light once more\r\nupon the footsteps in the dust.",
    "\"I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\" he said. \"Do you\r\nobserve anything noteworthy about them?\"",
    "\"They belong,\" I said, \"to a child or a small woman.\"",
    "\"Apart from their size, though.  Is there nothing else?\"",
    "\"They appear to be much as other footmarks.\"",
    "\"Not at all.  Look here!  This is the print of a right foot in the\r\ndust.  Now I make one with my naked foot beside it.  What is the chief\r\ndifference?\"",
    "\"Your toes are all #JJ# together.  The other print has each toe\r\ndistinctly divided.\"",
    "\"Quite so.  That is the point.  #NNP# that in mind.  Now, would you\r\nkindly step over to that #NN# and smell the edge of the\r\n#NN#?  I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\"",
    "I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong #VB#\r\nsmell.",
    "\"That is where he put his foot in getting out.  If YOU can trace him, I\r\nshould think that Toby will have no difficulty.  Now run down-stairs,\r\nloose the dog, and look out for #NN#.\"",
    "By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the\r\nroof, and I could see him like an enormous #NN# crawling very\r\nslowly along the ridge.  I lost sight of him behind a stack of\r\n#NNS#, but he presently #VBD#, and then vanished once more upon\r\nthe opposite side.  When I made my way round there I found him seated\r\nat one of the corner #NNS#.",
    "\"That you, Watson?\" he cried.",
    "\"This is the place.  What is that black thing down there?\"",
    "\"A #NN#.\"",
    "\"#JJ# on it?\"",
    "\"No sign of a ladder?\"",
    "\"#VB# the fellow!  It's a most #JJ# place.  I ought to be\r\nable to come down where he could climb up.  The water-pipe feels pretty\r\nfirm.  Here goes, anyhow.\"",
    "There was a #VBG# of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily\r\ndown the side of the wall.  Then with a light spring he came on to the\r\nbarrel, and from there to the earth.",
    "\"It was easy to follow him,\" he said, drawing on his stockings and\r\nboots.  \"#NNS# were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he\r\nhad dropped this.  It #VBZ# my #NN#, as you doctors express it.\"",
    "The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch #VBN# out\r\nof colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it.  In\r\nshape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a\r\ndozen #NN# of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other,\r\nlike that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.",
    "\"They are hellish things,\" said he.  \"Look out that you don't #NN#\r\nyourself.  I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they\r\nare all he has.  There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our\r\nskin before long.  I would sooner face a #NN# bullet, myself.  Are\r\nyou game for a #JJ# #NN#, Watson?\"",
    "\"Certainly,\" I answered.",
    "\"Your leg will stand it?\"",
    "\"Oh, yes.\"",
    "\"Here you are, #NN#!  Good old Toby!  #NN# it, Toby, smell it!\" He\r\npushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the\r\ncreature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most #JJ#\r\ncock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the #NN# of a famous\r\nvintage.  Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a\r\nstout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him to the foot of the\r\nwater-barrel.  The creature instantly broke into a succession of high,\r\n#JJ# yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the\r\nair, #VBD# off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and\r\nkept us at the top of our speed.",
    "The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some\r\ndistance in the cold gray light.  The square, massive house, with its\r\nblack, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn,\r\nbehind us.  Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among\r\nthe #NNS# and pits with which they were scarred and #VBN#.\r\nThe whole place, with its scattered #NNS# and #NN# shrubs,\r\nhad a #VBN#, ill-omened look which #VBN# with the black tragedy\r\nwhich hung over it.",
    "On reaching the #NN# wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,\r\nunderneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a\r\nyoung beech.  Where the two walls joined, several #NNS# had been\r\nloosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the\r\nlower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder.\r\nHolmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over\r\nupon the other side.",
    "\"There's the print of #NN#'s hand,\" he remarked, as I mounted up\r\nbeside him.  \"You see the slight #NN# of blood upon the white\r\nplaster.  What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain\r\nsince yesterday!  The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their\r\n#NN# hours' start.\"",
    "I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great\r\ntraffic which had passed along the London road in the interval.  My\r\nfears were soon appeased, however.  Toby never hesitated or #VBD#,\r\nbut #VBN# on in his peculiar rolling fashion.  #RB#, the pungent\r\nsmell of the creasote rose high above all other contending #NNS#.",
    "\"Do not imagine,\" said Holmes, \"that I depend for my success in this\r\ncase upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot\r\nin the chemical.  I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace\r\nthem in many different ways.  This, however, is the #NN# and, since\r\nfortune has put it into our hands, I should be #JJ# if I neglected\r\nit.  It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty\r\nlittle intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There\r\nmight have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too\r\n#JJ# clue.\"",
    "\"There is credit, and to spare,\" said I.  \"I assure you, Holmes, that I\r\n#VB# at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even\r\nmore than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to\r\nbe deeper and more inexplicable.  How, for example, could you describe\r\nwith such confidence the wooden-legged man?\"",
    "\"#NN#, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself.  I don't wish to be\r\n#JJ#.  It is all #NN# and #NN#.  Two officers who are in\r\ncommand of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried\r\ntreasure.  A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan\r\nSmall.  You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain\r\nMorstan's possession.  He had signed it in behalf of himself and his\r\nassociates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat #RB# called\r\nit.  #VBN# by this chart, the #NN# one of #NNS# the\r\ntreasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some\r\ncondition under which he received it #JJ#.  Now, then, why did\r\nnot Jonathan Small get the treasure himself?  The answer is obvious.\r\nThe chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close\r\n#NN# with #NNS#.  Jonathan Small did not get the treasure\r\nbecause he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not\r\nget away.\"",
    "\"But that is mere speculation,\" said I.",
    "\"It is more than that.  It is the only hypothesis which covers the\r\nfacts.  Let us see how it fits in with the sequel.  Major Sholto\r\nremains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his\r\ntreasure.  Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great\r\nfright.  What was that?\"",
    "\"A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\"",
    "\"Or had escaped.  That is much more likely, for he would have known\r\nwhat their term of imprisonment was.  It would not have been a surprise\r\nto him.  What does he do then?  He guards himself against a\r\nwooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he #NNS# a white\r\ntradesman for him, and actually fires a #NN# at him.  Now, only one\r\nwhite man's name is on the chart.  The others are #NNS# or\r\n#NNS#.  There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with\r\nconfidence that the wooden-legged man is #JJ# with Jonathan Small.\r\nDoes the reasoning strike you as being #JJ#?\"",
    "\"No:  it is clear and concise.\"",
    "\"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us\r\nlook at it from his point of view.  He comes to England with the double\r\nidea of #VBG# what he would consider to be his rights and of having\r\nhis revenge upon the man who had wronged him.  He found out where\r\nSholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some\r\none inside the house.  There is this butler, Lal #NN#, whom we have not\r\nseen.  Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could\r\nnot find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever\r\nknew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died.  Suddenly\r\nSmall #VBZ# that the major is on his death-bed.  In a frenzy lest the\r\nsecret of the treasure die with him, he runs the #NN# of the\r\nguards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only #VBN#\r\nfrom entering by the presence of his two sons.  Mad with hate, however,\r\nagainst the dead man, he #VBZ# the room that night, #NNS# his\r\nprivate papers in the hope of discovering some #NN# #VBG# to\r\nthe treasure, and finally leaves a #NN# of his visit in the short\r\ninscription upon the card.  He had #RB# planned #RB# that\r\nshould he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body\r\nas a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view\r\nof the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice.\r\n#JJ# and bizarre #NNS# of this kind are common enough in the\r\nannals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the\r\ncriminal.  Do you follow all this?\"",
    "\"Now, what could Jonathan Small do?  He could only continue to keep a\r\nsecret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he\r\nleaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the\r\ndiscovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it.  We again\r\ntrace the presence of some confederate in the household.  Jonathan,\r\nwith his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of\r\nBartholomew Sholto.  He takes with him, however, a rather curious\r\nassociate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into\r\ncreasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer\r\nwith a damaged #NN# #NNS#.\"",
    "\"But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\"",
    "\"Quite so.  And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he\r\nstamped about when he got into the room.  He bore no grudge against\r\nBartholomew Sholto, and would have #JJ# if he could have been\r\nsimply bound and gagged.  He did not wish to put his head in a #NN#.\r\nThere was no help for it, however:  the savage instincts of his\r\ncompanion had broken out, and the poison had done its work:  so\r\nJonathan Small left his record, lowered the #NN# to the ground,\r\nand followed it himself.  That was the train of events as far as I can\r\n#VB# them.  Of course as to his personal appearance he must be\r\nmiddle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an\r\noven as the #NNS#. His height is readily #VBN# from the length\r\nof his stride, and we know that he was bearded.  His #NN# was the\r\none point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him\r\nat the window.  I don't know that there is anything else.\"",
    "\"The associate?\"",
    "\"Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that.  But you will know all\r\nabout it soon enough.  How sweet the morning air is!  See how that one\r\nlittle cloud #VBZ# like a pink feather from some gigantic #NN#.\r\nNow the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank.\r\nIt shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare #NN#, who are on a\r\nstranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty\r\nambitions and #NNS# in the presence of the great elemental forces\r\nof nature!  Are you well up in your #NNP# Paul?\"",
    "\"#RB# so.  I worked back to him through #NNP#.\"",
    "\"That was like following the brook to the #NN# lake.  He makes one\r\ncurious but profound remark.  It is that the chief proof of man's real\r\ngreatness lies in his #NN# of his own #NN#. It #VBZ#, you\r\nsee, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a\r\nproof of #NN#.  There is much food for thought in #NNP#.  You\r\nhave not a pistol, have you?\"",
    "\"I have my stick.\"",
    "\"It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get\r\nto their lair.  Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns\r\nnasty I shall shoot him dead.\"  He took out his revolver as he spoke,\r\nand, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the\r\nright-hand pocket of his jacket.",
    "We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the\r\n#NN# #VBN# roads which lead to the #NNS#. Now,\r\nhowever, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where\r\nlaborers and #NN# were already astir, and #RB# women were\r\ntaking down shutters and #VBG# #NN#.  At the #VBN#\r\ncorner public houses business was just beginning, and #VBG# men\r\nwere #VBG#, rubbing their #NNS# across their #NNS# after their\r\nmorning wet.  Strange dogs sauntered up and stared #RB# at us as\r\nwe passed, but our #JJ# Toby looked neither to the right nor to\r\nthe left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an\r\noccasional eager #NN# which spoke of a hot scent.",
    "We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found\r\nourselves in #NNP# Lane, having borne away through the\r\n#NN# to the east of the #JJ#.  The men whom we pursued seemed\r\nto have taken a curiously #NN# road, with the idea probably of\r\nescaping observation.  They had never kept to the main road if a\r\nparallel #NN# would serve their turn.  At the foot of Kennington\r\nLane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles\r\nStreet.  Where the latter street turns into #NNP#'s Place, Toby ceased\r\nto advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked\r\nand the other drooping, the very picture of canine #NN#.  Then he\r\nwaddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to\r\nask for sympathy in his embarrassment.",
    "\"What the deuce is the matter with the dog?\" growled Holmes. \"They\r\nsurely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\"",
    "\"Perhaps they stood here for some time,\" I suggested.",
    "\"Ah! it's all right.  He's off again,\" said my companion, in a tone of\r\nrelief.",
    "He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up\r\nhis mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he\r\nhad not yet shown.  The scent appeared to be much #JJR# than before,\r\nfor he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but #VBD# at his\r\nleash and tried to break into a run.  I cold see by the gleam in\r\nHolmes's eyes that he thought we were #VBG# the end of our journey.",
    "Our course now ran down #NN# #NNS# until we came to #NNP# and\r\n#NNP#'s large #NN#, just past the White #NNP# #NN#. Here the\r\ndog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the #NN# into\r\nthe #NN#, where the #NN# were already at work.  On the dog\r\n#VBD# through #NN# and #NNS#, down an alley, round a passage,\r\nbetween two #NNS#, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang\r\nupon a large barrel which still stood upon the #NN# on which it\r\nhad been brought.  With #VBG# tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood\r\nupon the #NN#, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of\r\nappreciation.  The #VBZ# of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley\r\nwere #VBN# with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the\r\nsmell of creasote.",
    "Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst\r\nsimultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.",
    "Chapter VIII",
    "The Baker Street #NNS#",
    "\"What now?\" I asked.  \"Toby has lost his character for #NN#.\"",
    "\"He acted according to his lights,\" said Holmes, lifting him down from\r\nthe barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard.  \"If you consider\r\nhow much creasote is #VBD# about London in one day, it is no great\r\nwonder that our trail should have been crossed.  It is much used now,\r\nespecially for the #VBG# of wood.  Poor Toby is not to blame.\"",
    "\"We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\"",
    "\"Yes.  And, fortunately, we have no distance to go.  Evidently what\r\npuzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two\r\ndifferent #NNS# running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one.\r\nIt only remains to follow the other.\"",
    "There was no difficulty about this.  On leading Toby to the place where\r\nhe had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally\r\ndashed off in a fresh direction.",
    "\"We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the\r\n#NN# came from,\" I observed.",
    "\"I had thought of that.  But you notice that he keeps on the pavement,\r\nwhereas the barrel passed down the roadway.  No, we are on the true\r\nscent now.\"",
    "It tended down towards the #NN#, running through #NNP# Place\r\nand Prince's Street.  At the end of #NNP# Street it ran right down to\r\nthe water's edge, where there was a small wooden #NN#.  Toby led us to\r\nthe very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark\r\ncurrent beyond.",
    "\"We are out of luck,\" said Holmes.  \"They have taken to a boat here.\"\r\nSeveral small #NNS# and #NNS# were lying about in the water and on the\r\nedge of the wharf.  We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he\r\n#VBD# earnestly, he made no sign.",
    "Close to the rude #NN# was a small brick house, with a wooden\r\nplacard slung out through the second window.  \"#NN# Smith\" was\r\nprinted across it in large letters, and, underneath, \"#NNS# to hire by\r\nthe hour or day.\"  A second inscription above the door informed us that\r\na steam launch was kept,--a statement which was confirmed by a great\r\npile of #NN# upon the #NN#. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and\r\nhis face assumed an ominous expression.",
    "\"This looks bad,\" said he.  \"These fellows are #JJR# than I expected.\r\nThey seem to have covered their tracks.  There has, I fear, been\r\n#VBN# management here.\"",
    "He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little,\r\n#VBN# lad of six came running out, followed by a #NN#,\r\nred-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.",
    "\"You come back and be washed, Jack,\" she shouted.  \"Come back, you\r\nyoung #NN#; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he'll\r\nlet us hear of it.\"",
    "\"Dear little chap!\" said Holmes, #RB#.  \"What a #VBN#\r\nyoung rascal!  Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\"",
    "The youth pondered for a moment.  \"I'd like a #NN#',\" said he.",
    "\"Nothing you would like better?\"",
    "\"I'd like two shillin' better,\" the #NN# answered, after some\r\nthought.",
    "\"Here you are, then!  #NN#!--A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\"",
    "\"#NN#' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward.  He gets a'most too much\r\nfor me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a time.\"",
    "\"#RB#, is he?\" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice.  \"I am sorry for\r\nthat, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\"",
    "\"He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I am\r\nbeginnin' to feel frightened about him.  But if it was about a boat,\r\nsir, maybe I could serve as well.\"",
    "\"I wanted to hire his steam launch.\"",
    "\"Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.\r\nThat's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her than\r\nwould take her to about Woolwich and back.  If he'd been away in the\r\nbarge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him as\r\nfar as #NNP#, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha'\r\nstayed over.  But what good is a steam launch without coals?\"",
    "\"He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\"",
    "\"He might, sir, but it weren't his way.  Many a time I've heard him\r\ncall out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don't\r\nlike that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and #JJ# talk.\r\nWhat did he want always #NN#' about here for?\"",
    "\"A wooden-legged man?\" said Holmes, with #JJ# surprise.",
    "\"Yes, sir, a brown, #VBN# chap that's called more'n once for my\r\nold man.  It was him that roused him up #NN#, and, what's more,\r\nmy man knew he was #VBG#', for he had steam up in the #NN#.  I tell\r\nyou straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it.\"",
    "\"But, my dear Mrs. Smith,\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \"You\r\nare #JJ# yourself about nothing.  How could you possibly tell\r\nthat it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night?  I don't quite\r\nunderstand how you can be so sure.\"",
    "\"His voice, sir.  I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy.\r\nHe tapped at the #NN#,#NN# three it would be.  'Show a leg,\r\n#NN#,' says he:  'time to turn out guard.'  My old man woke up\r\nJim,--that's my eldest,--and away they went, without so much as a word\r\nto me.  I could hear the wooden leg #NN#' on the stones.\"",
    "\"And was this wooden-legged man alone?\"",
    "\"#NN#'t say, I am sure, sir.  I didn't hear no one else.\"",
    "\"I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard\r\ngood reports of #NN# me see, what is her name?\"",
    "\"The #NNP#, sir.\"",
    "\"Ah!  She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in\r\nthe beam?\"",
    "\"No, indeed.  She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. She's\r\nbeen fresh painted, black with two red #NNS#.\"",
    "\"#NNS#.  I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith.  I am going\r\ndown the river; and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let\r\nhim know that you are uneasy.  A black funnel, you say?\"",
    "\"No, sir.  Black with a white band.\"",
    "\"Ah, of course.  It was the sides which were black. #VBG#, Mrs.\r\nSmith.#NN# is a #NN# here with a #NN#, Watson.  We shall take\r\nit and cross the river.",
    "\"The main thing with people of that sort,\" said Holmes, as we sat in\r\nthe #NNS# of the wherry, \"is never to let them think that their\r\ninformation can be of the slightest importance to you.  If you do, they\r\nwill instantly shut up like an oyster.  If you listen to them under\r\nprotest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\"",
    "\"Our course now seems pretty clear,\" said I.",
    "\"What would you do, then?\"",
    "\"I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the\r\nAurora.\"",
    "\"My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task.  She may have touched at\r\nany wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.\r\nBelow the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of #NNS# for\r\nmiles.  It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set\r\nabout it alone.\"",
    "\"#VB# the police, then.\"",
    "\"No.  I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is\r\nnot a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would\r\n#VB# him #RB#.  But I have a fancy for working it out\r\nmyself, now that we have gone so far.\"",
    "\"Could we #VB#, then, asking for information from #NNS#?\"",
    "\"Worse and worse!  Our men would know that the chase was hot at their\r\nheels, and they would be off out of the country.  As it is, they are\r\nlikely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly\r\nsafe they will be in no hurry.  Jones's energy will be of use to us\r\nthere, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily\r\npress, and the #NNS# will think that every one is off on the wrong\r\nscent.\"",
    "\"What are we to do, then?\" I asked, as we #VBD# near Millbank\r\n#NN#.",
    "\"Take this #JJ#, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour's\r\nsleep.  It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again.\r\n#VB# at a #NN#, cabby!  We will keep Toby, for he may be of\r\nuse to us yet.\"",
    "We pulled up at the Great #NNP# Street post-office, and Holmes\r\n#VBD# his wire.  \"#WP# do you think that is to?\" he asked, as we\r\nresumed our journey.",
    "\"I am sure I don't know.\"",
    "\"You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force\r\nwhom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\"",
    "\"Well,\" said I, laughing.",
    "\"This is just the case where they might be invaluable.  If they fail, I\r\nhave other resources; but I shall try them first.  That wire was to my\r\ndirty little lieutenant, #NNP#, and I expect that he and his gang\r\nwill be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\"",
    "It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a\r\nstrong reaction after the successive #NNS# of the night. I was\r\nlimp and weary, #JJ# in mind and #VBN# in body.  I had not the\r\nprofessional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look\r\nat the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem.  As far as the\r\ndeath of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and\r\ncould feel no intense #NN# to his murderers.  The treasure,\r\nhowever, was a different matter.  That, or part of it, belonged\r\n#RB# to Miss Morstan.  While there was a chance of recovering it\r\nI was ready to devote my life to the one object.  #JJ#, if I found it\r\nit would probably put her forever beyond my reach.  Yet it would be a\r\npetty and #JJ# love which would be influenced by such a thought as\r\nthat.  If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a #RB#\r\nstronger reason to #VB# me on to find the treasure.",
    "A #NN# at Baker Street and a complete change #VBN# me up\r\nwonderfully.  When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid\r\nand Homes pouring out the coffee.",
    "\"Here it is,\" said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.\r\n\"The energetic Jones and the #JJ# reporter have fixed it up\r\nbetween them.  But you have had enough of the case. Better have your\r\n#NN# and eggs first.\"",
    "I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed\r\n\"#JJ# #NNP# at Upper Norwood.\"",
    "\"About twelve o'clock last night,\" said the #NNP#, \"Mr. Bartholomew\r\nSholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room\r\nunder circumstances which point to foul play.  As far as we can learn,\r\nno actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a\r\nvaluable collection of Indian #NNS# which the deceased gentleman had\r\ninherited from his father has been carried off.  The discovery was\r\nfirst made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the\r\nhouse with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.  By a singular\r\npiece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the\r\ndetective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station,\r\nand was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm.  His\r\ntrained and experienced #NNS# were at once directed towards the\r\ndetection of the criminals, with the #JJ# result that the\r\nbrother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a\r\nporter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo.  It is quite certain that the\r\nthief or #NNS# were well #VBN# with the house, for Mr. Jones's\r\nwell-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation\r\nhave enabled him to prove conclusively that the #NNS# could not\r\nhave entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way\r\nacross the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room\r\nwhich communicated with that in which the body was found.  This fact,\r\nwhich has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was\r\nno mere #JJ# burglary.  The #NN# and energetic action of the\r\nofficers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such\r\n#NNS# of a single vigorous and masterful mind.  We cannot but think\r\nthat it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our\r\ndetectives more #JJ#, and so brought into closer and more\r\neffective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\"",
    "\"#NN#'t it #JJ#!\" said Holmes, grinning over his #NN#. \"What\r\ndo you think of it?\"",
    "\"I think that we have had a close #VB# ourselves of being arrested for\r\nthe crime.\"",
    "\"So do I.  I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happen to\r\nhave another of his attacks of energy.\"",
    "At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs.\r\nHudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of #NN# and\r\n#NN#.",
    "\"By heaven, Holmes,\" I said, half rising, \"I believe that they are\r\nreally after us.\"",
    "\"No, it's not quite so bad as that.  It is the unofficial force,--the\r\nBaker Street #NNS#.\"",
    "As he spoke, there came a swift #VBG# of naked feet upon the\r\nstairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and\r\nragged little #NN#.  There was some show of discipline among\r\nthem, #IN# their #JJ# entry, for they instantly drew up in\r\nline and stood facing us with expectant faces.  One of their number,\r\ntaller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging\r\n#NN# which was very funny in such a #JJ# little\r\nscarecrow.",
    "\"Got your message, sir,\" said he, \"and brought 'em on sharp. Three #NN#\r\nand a #NN# for tickets.\"",
    "\"Here you are,\" said Holmes, producing some silver.  \"In future they\r\ncan report to you, Wiggins, and you to me.  I cannot have the house\r\ninvaded in this way.  However, it is just as well that you should all\r\n#NN# the instructions.  I want to find the whereabouts of a steam\r\nlaunch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red\r\nstreaks, funnel black with a white band.  She is down the river\r\nsomewhere.  I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage\r\nopposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back.  You must #VB# it\r\nout among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly.  Let me know the\r\nmoment you have news.  Is that all clear?\"",
    "\"Yes, #NN#'nor,\" said Wiggins.",
    "\"The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.\r\nHere's a day in advance.  Now off you go!\"  He handed them a #VBG#\r\neach, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment\r\nlater streaming down the street.",
    "\"If the launch is above water they will find her,\" said Holmes, as he\r\nrose from the table and lit his pipe.  \"They can go everywhere, see\r\neverything, overhear every one.  I expect to hear before evening that\r\nthey have spotted her.  In the mean while, we can do nothing but await\r\nresults.  We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the\r\nAurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\"",
    "\"Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say.  Are you going to bed,\r\nHolmes?\"",
    "\"No:  I am not tired.  I have a curious constitution.  I never remember\r\nfeeling tired by work, though idleness #NNS# me completely.  I am\r\ngoing to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair\r\nclient has introduced us.  If ever man had an easy task, this of ours\r\nought to be.  #VBN# men are not so common, but the other man\r\nmust, I should think, be absolutely unique.\"",
    "\"That other man again!\"",
    "\"I have no #NN# to make a mystery of him,#NN# you, anyway.  But you\r\nmust have formed your own opinion.  Now, do consider the data.\r\n#JJ# footmarks, toes never #VBN# by boots, naked feet,\r\nstone-headed wooden #NN#, great #NN#, small poisoned darts.  What do\r\nyou make of all this?\"",
    "\"A savage!\" I exclaimed.  \"Perhaps one of those Indians who were the\r\nassociates of Jonathan Small.\"",
    "\"Hardly that,\" said he.  \"When first I saw signs of strange weapons I\r\nwas inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks\r\ncaused me to reconsider my views.  Some of the inhabitants of the\r\nIndian #NNP# are small men, but none could have left such marks as\r\nthat.  The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet.  The #VBG#\r\n#NN# has the great toe well separated from the others, because\r\nthe thong is #RB# passed between.  These little darts, too, could\r\nonly be shot in one way. They are from a #NN#.  Now, then, where\r\nare we to find our savage?\"",
    "\"South American,\" I hazarded.",
    "He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.\r\n\"This is the first volume of a #NN# which is now being published.\r\nIt may be looked upon as the very latest authority.

The average\r\nheight is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may\r\nbe found who are very much smaller than this.

These\r\n#NNS# are invariably concluded by a #JJ# #NN#.'  #JJ#, amiable\r\npeople, Watson!  If this fellow had been left to his own #JJ#\r\ndevices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn.  I\r\nfancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to\r\nhave employed him.\"",
    "\"But how came he to have so singular a companion?\"",
    "\"Ah, that is more than I can tell.  Since, however, we had already\r\ndetermined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very\r\nwonderful that this #NN# should be with him.  No doubt we shall\r\nknow all about it in time.  Look here, Watson; you look #RB# done.\r\n#NNP# down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\"",
    "He took up his #NN# from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he\r\nbegan to play some low, dreamy, #JJ# air,#NNS# own, no doubt, for\r\nhe had a remarkable gift for #NN#.  I have a vague remembrance\r\nof his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow.\r\nThen I seemed to be floated #RB# away upon a soft sea of sound,\r\nuntil I found myself in #NN#, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan\r\nlooking down upon me.",

    "A #NN# in the Chain",
    "It was late in the afternoon before I woke, #VBN# and refreshed.\r\nSherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had\r\nlaid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me,\r\nas I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.",
    "\"You have slept soundly,\" he said.  \"I feared that our talk would #VB#\r\nyou.\"",
    "\"I heard nothing,\" I answered.  \"Have you had fresh news, then?\"",
    "\"Unfortunately, no.  I confess that I am surprised and disappointed.  I\r\nexpected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to\r\nreport.  He says that no trace can be found of the launch.  It is a\r\n#VBG# check, for every hour is of importance.\"",
    "\"Can I do anything?  I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for\r\nanother night's #VBG#.\"",
    "\"No, we can do nothing.  We can only wait.  If we go ourselves, the\r\nmessage might come in our absence, and delay be caused.  You can do\r\nwhat you will, but I must remain on guard.\"",
    "\"Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil\r\nForrester.  She asked me to, yesterday.\"",
    "\"On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in\r\nhis eyes.",
    "\"Well, of course Miss Morstan too.  They were anxious to hear what\r\nhappened.\"",
    "\"I would not tell them too much,\" said Holmes.  \"#NNP# are never to be\r\nentirely trusted,#NN# the best of them.\"",
    "I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment.  \"I shall be\r\nback in an hour or two,\" I remarked.",
    "\"All right!  Good luck!  But, I say, if you are crossing the river you\r\nmay as well return Toby, for I don't think it is at all likely that we\r\nshall have any use for him now.\"",
    "I took our mongrel #RB#, and left him, together with a\r\n#NN#, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane.  At Camberwell\r\nI found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but\r\nvery eager to hear the news.  Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of\r\ncuriosity.  I told them all that we had done, #VBG#, however, the\r\nmore dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr.\r\nSholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.\r\nWith all my #NNS#, however, there was enough to #VB# and #VB#\r\nthem.",
    "\"It is a romance!\" cried Mrs. Forrester.  \"An injured lady, half a\r\nmillion in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged #NN#.\r\nThey take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked #NN#.\"",
    "\"And two #NNS# to the rescue,\" added Miss Morstan, with a\r\nbright glance at me.",
    "\"Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don't\r\nthink that you are nearly excited enough.  Just imagine what it must be\r\nto be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\"",
    "It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no\r\nsign of elation at the prospect.  On the contrary, she gave a #NN# of\r\nher proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small\r\ninterest.",
    "\"It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\" she said. \"Nothing\r\nelse is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly\r\nand honorably throughout.  It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful\r\nand #JJ# charge.\"",
    "It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I\r\nreached home.  My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he\r\nhad disappeared.  I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but\r\nthere was none.",
    "\"I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\" I said to Mrs.\r\nHudson as she came up to lower the blinds.",
    "\"No, sir.  He has gone to his room, sir.  Do you know, sir,\" sinking\r\nher voice into an impressive whisper, \"I am afraid for his health?\"",
    "\"Why so, Mrs. Hudson?\"",
    "\"Well, he's that strange, sir.  After you was gone he walked and he\r\nwalked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of\r\nhis #NN#.  Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and\r\nevery time the bell rang out he came on the #NN#, with 'What is\r\nthat, Mrs. Hudson?'  And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can\r\nhear him walking away the same as ever.  I hope he's not going to be\r\nill, sir.  I ventured to say something to him about cooling #NN#,\r\nbut he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how ever I\r\ngot out of the room.\"",
    "\"I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\" I\r\nanswered.  \"I have seen him like this before.  He has some small matter\r\nupon his mind which makes him restless.\"  I tried to speak lightly to\r\nour worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the\r\nlong night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread,\r\nand knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary\r\ninaction.",
    "At #NN# he looked worn and haggard, with a little #NN# of\r\nfeverish color upon either cheek.",
    "\"You are knocking yourself up, old man,\" I remarked.  \"I heard you\r\n#VBG# about in the night.\"",
    "\"No, I could not sleep,\" he answered.  \"This infernal problem is\r\n#VBG# me.  It is too much to be #VBD# by so petty an obstacle,\r\nwhen all else had been #VB#.  I know the men, the launch,\r\neverything; and yet I can get no news.  I have set other agencies at\r\nwork, and used every means at my disposal.  The whole river has been\r\nsearched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard\r\nof her husband.  I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have\r\nscuttled the craft.  But there are objections to that.\"",
    "\"Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\"",
    "\"No, I think that may be dismissed.  I had inquiries made, and there is\r\na launch of that description.\"",
    "\"Could it have gone up the river?\"",
    "\"I have considered that possibility too, and there is a #NN#\r\nwho will work up as far as #NNP#.  If no news comes to-day, I shall\r\nstart off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat.\r\nBut surely, surely, we shall hear something.\"",
    "We did not, however.  Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from\r\nthe other agencies.  There were articles in most of the papers upon the\r\nNorwood tragedy.  They all appeared to be rather #JJ# to the\r\nunfortunate Thaddeus Sholto.  No fresh details were to be found,\r\nhowever, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the\r\nfollowing day.  I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report\r\nour ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected\r\nand somewhat morose.  He would hardly reply to my questions, and #VBD#\r\nhimself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved\r\nmuch #VBG# of retorts and #VBG# of #NNS#, ending at last in a\r\nsmell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours\r\nof the morning I could hear the #VBG# of his test-tubes which told\r\nme that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.",
    "In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him\r\nstanding by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket,\r\nand a coarse red #NN# round his neck.",
    "\"I am off down the river, Watson,\" said he.  \"I have been turning it\r\nover in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it.  It is worth\r\ntrying, at all events.\"",
    "\"Surely I can come with you, then?\" said I.",
    "\"No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my\r\nrepresentative.  I am #JJ# to go, for it is quite on the cards that\r\nsome message may come during the day, though Wiggins was #JJ#\r\nabout it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to\r\nact on your own judgment if any news should come.  Can I rely upon you?\"",
    "\"Most certainly.\"",
    "\"I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly\r\ntell yet where I may find myself.  If I am in luck, however, I may not\r\nbe gone so very long.  I shall have news of some sort or other before I\r\nget back.\"",
    "I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time.  On opening the Standard,\r\nhowever, I found that there was a fresh #NN# to the business.\r\n\"With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\" it remarked, \"we have\r\nreason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and\r\nmysterious than was originally supposed. #JJ# evidence has shown that\r\nit is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any\r\nway concerned in the matter.  He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone,\r\nwere both released yesterday evening.  It is believed, however, that\r\nthe police have a clue as to the real #NNS#, and that it is being\r\n#VBN# by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his\r\nwell-known energy and sagacity.  #RB# #NNS# may be expected at any\r\nmoment.\"",
    "\"That is satisfactory so far as it goes,\" thought I.  \"Friend Sholto is\r\nsafe, at any rate.  I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it\r\nseems to be a #JJ# form whenever the police have made a blunder.\"",
    "I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye\r\ncaught an advertisement in the agony column.  It ran in this way:",
    "\"Lost.#NNS# Mordecai Smith, #NN#oatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith's\r\n#NNP# at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam\r\nlaunch Aurora, black with two red #NNS#, funnel black with a white\r\nband, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give\r\ninformation to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at #CD#b Baker Street,\r\nas to the whereabouts of the #NN# Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.\"",
    "This was clearly Holmes's doing.  The Baker Street address was enough\r\nto prove that.  It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be\r\nread by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural\r\nanxiety of a wife for her missing husband.",
    "It was a long day.  Every time that a #NN# came to the door, or a\r\nsharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes\r\nreturning or an answer to his advertisement.  I tried to read, but my\r\nthoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the #VBN#\r\nand villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered,\r\nsome #JJ# flaw in my companion's reasoning.  Might he be suffering\r\nfrom some huge #NN#? Was it not possible that his #JJ# and\r\n#JJ# mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises?  I\r\nhad never known him to be wrong; and yet the #JJS# reasoner may\r\noccasionally be #VBN#.  He was likely, I thought, to fall into error\r\nthrough the #NN# of his #NN#,--his #NN# for a subtle\r\nand bizarre explanation when a #JJR# and more commonplace one lay\r\nready to his hand.  Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the\r\nevidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions.  When I\r\nlooked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them\r\ntrivial in themselves, but all #VBG# in the same direction, I could\r\nnot disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were\r\n#JJ# the true theory must be equally #NN# and startling.",
    "At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud #JJ# at the bell, an\r\n#JJ# voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person\r\nthan Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me.  Very different was he,\r\nhowever, from the #NN# and masterful professor of common sense who\r\nhad taken over the case so #RB# at Upper Norwood.  His\r\nexpression was downcast, and his bearing #JJ# and even apologetic.",
    "\"#NN#, sir; #NN#,\" said he.  \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I\r\nunderstand.\"",
    "\"Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back.  But perhaps you would\r\ncare to wait.  Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\"",
    "\"Thank you; I don't mind if I do,\" said he, mopping his face with a red\r\n#NN# handkerchief.",
    "\"And a #NN#?\"",
    "\"Well, half a glass.  It is very hot for the time of year; and I have\r\nhad a good deal to worry and try me.  You know my theory about this\r\nNorwood case?\"",
    "\"I remember that you expressed one.\"",
    "\"Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it.  I had my net drawn\r\ntightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when #NN# he went through a hole in the\r\nmiddle of it.  He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken.\r\nFrom the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight\r\nof some one or other.  So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and\r\nthrough #NNS#.  It's a very dark case, and my professional credit\r\nis at stake.  I should be very glad of a little assistance.\"",
    "\"We all need help sometimes,\" said I.",
    "\"Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\" said he, in\r\na husky and confidential voice.  \"He's a man who is not to be beat.  I\r\nhave known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw\r\nthe case yet that he could not throw a light upon.  He is irregular in\r\nhis methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on\r\nthe whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I\r\ndon't care who knows it.  I have had a wire from him this morning, by\r\nwhich I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business.\r\nHere is the message.\"",
    "He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me.  It was\r\ndated from #NN# at twelve o'clock.  \"Go to Baker Street at once,\" it\r\nsaid.  \"If I have not returned, wait for me.  I am close on the track\r\nof the Sholto gang.  You can come with us to-night if you want to be in\r\nat the finish.\"",
    "\"This sounds well.  He has evidently picked up the scent again,\" said I.",
    "\"Ah, then he has been at fault too,\" exclaimed Jones, with evident\r\nsatisfaction.  \"Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes.  Of\r\ncourse this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an\r\nofficer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at\r\nthe door.  Perhaps this is he.\"",
    "A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and\r\nrattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or\r\ntwice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at\r\nlast he made his way to our door and entered.  His appearance\r\ncorresponded to the sounds which we had heard.  He was an aged man,\r\nclad in seafaring #NN#, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his\r\nthroat.  His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing\r\nwas #RB# asthmatic.  As he leaned upon a thick oaken #NN# his\r\nshoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs.  He had\r\na colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save\r\na pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray\r\n#NN#. #RB# he gave me the impression of a respectable\r\nmaster mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.",
    "\"What is it, my man?\" I asked.",
    "He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.",
    "\"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\" said he.",
    "\"No; but I am acting for him.  You can tell me any message you have for\r\nhim.\"",
    "\"It was to him himself I was to tell it,\" said he.",
    "\"But I tell you that I am acting for him.  Was it about Mordecai\r\nSmith's boat?\"",
    "\"Yes.  I knows well where it is.  An' I knows where the men he is after\r\nare.  An' I knows where the treasure is.  I knows all about it.\"",
    "\"Then tell me, and I shall let him know.\"",
    "\"It was to him I was to tell it,\" he repeated, with the petulant\r\n#NN# of a very old man.",
    "\"Well, you must wait for him.\"",
    "\"No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one.  If Mr.\r\nHolmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself.  I\r\ndon't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word.\"",
    "He #VBD# towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.",
    "\"Wait a bit, my friend,\" said he.  \"You have important information, and\r\nyou must not walk off.  We shall keep you, whether you like or not,\r\nuntil our friend #NNS#.\"",
    "The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones\r\nput his broad back up against it, he recognized the #NN# of\r\n#NN#.",
    "\"Pretty sort o' treatment this!\" he cried, #VBG# his stick. \"I come\r\nhere to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize\r\nme and treat me in this fashion!\"",
    "\"You will be none the worse,\" I said.  \"We shall #NN# you for the\r\nloss of your time.  Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have\r\nlong to wait.\"",
    "He came across #RB# enough, and seated himself with his face\r\nresting on his hands.  Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.\r\nSuddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us.",
    "\"I think that you might offer me a cigar too,\" he said.",
    "We both started in our chairs.  There was Holmes sitting close to us\r\nwith an air of quiet amusement.",
    "\"Holmes!\" I exclaimed.  \"You here!  But where is the old man?\"",
    "\"Here is the old man,\" said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \"Here\r\nhe is,#NN#, whiskers, eyebrows, and all.  I thought my disguise was\r\npretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\"",
    "\"Ah, You rogue!\" cried Jones, highly delighted.  \"You would have made\r\nan #NN#, and a rare one.  You had the proper #NN# cough, and\r\nthose weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew\r\nthe glint of your eye, though.  You didn't get away from us so easily,\r\nYou see.\"",
    "\"I have been working in that #NN# all day,\" said he, lighting his\r\ncigar.  \"You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know\r\nme,--especially since our friend here took to #VBG# some of my\r\ncases:  so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise\r\nlike this.  You got my wire?\"",
    "\"Yes; that was what brought me here.\"",
    "\"How has your case prospered?\"",
    "\"It has all come to nothing.  I have had to #NN# two of my\r\nprisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.\"",
    "\"Never mind.  We shall give you two others in the place of them. But\r\nyou must put yourself under my orders.  You are welcome to all the\r\nofficial credit, but you must act on the line that I point out.  Is\r\nthat agreed?\"",
    "\"Entirely, if you will help me to the men.\"",
    "\"Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast #NN#\r\nsteam #NN# be at the Westminster #NNP# at seven o'clock.\"",
    "\"That is easily managed.  There is always one about there; but I can\r\nstep across the road and telephone to make sure.\"",
    "\"Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.\"",
    "\"There will be two or three in the boat.  What else?\"",
    "\"When we secure the men we shall get the treasure.  I think that it\r\nwould be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the\r\nyoung lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs.  Let her be the first\r\nto open it.#NN#, Watson?\"",
    "\"It would be a great pleasure to me.\"",
    "\"Rather an irregular proceeding,\" said Jones, shaking his head.\r\n\"However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at\r\nit.  The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities\r\nuntil after the official investigation.\"",
    "\"Certainly.  That is easily managed.  One other point.  I should much\r\nlike to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan\r\nSmall himself.

    "\"That is understood, then?\"",
    "\"Perfectly.  Is there anything else?\"",
    "\"Only that I insist upon your dining with us.  It will be ready in half\r\nan hour.  I have oysters and a brace of #VBP#, with something a little\r\nchoice in white wines.#NN#, you have never yet recognized my #NNS#\r\nas a housekeeper.\"",
    "Chapter X",
    "The End of the #NNP#",
    "Our meal was a merry one.  Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he\r\nchose, and that night he did choose.  He appeared to be in a state of\r\nnervous exaltation.  I have never known him so brilliant.  He spoke on\r\na quick succession of subjects,#NN# #NNS#, on medieval #NN#,\r\non Stradivarius violins, on the #NNP# of #NNP#, and on the\r\n#NN# of the future,#VBG# each as though he had made a special\r\nstudy of it.  His bright humor marked the reaction from his black\r\ndepression of the #VBG# days.  Athelney Jones proved to be a\r\nsociable soul in his hours of #NN#, and faced his dinner with the\r\nair of a #FW# #NN#.  For myself, I felt #JJ# at the thought that we\r\nwere nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's\r\n#NN#.  None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had\r\nbrought us together.",
    "When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up\r\nthree glasses with port.  \"One #NN#,\" said he, \"to the success of our\r\nlittle expedition.  And now it is high time we were off.  Have you a\r\npistol, Watson?\"",
    "\"I have my old #NN# in my desk.\"",
    "\"You had best take it, then.  It is well to be prepared.  I see that\r\nthe cab is at the door.  I ordered it for half-past six.\"",
    "It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and\r\nfound our launch awaiting us.  Holmes #VBD# it #RB#.",
    "\"Is there anything to mark it as a #NN#?\"",
    "\"Yes,--that green lamp at the side.\"",
    "\"Then take it off.\"",
    "The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast\r\noff.  Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern.  There was one man at the\r\n#NN#, one to tend the engines, and two burly #NN#\r\nforward.",
    "\"Where to?\" asked Jones.",
    "\"To the #NNP#.  Tell them to stop opposite #NNP#'s Yard.\"",
    "Our craft was evidently a very fast one.  We shot past the long lines\r\nof loaded #NNS# as though they were stationary.  Holmes smiled with\r\nsatisfaction as we #VBN# a river steamer and left her behind us.",
    "\"We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\" he said.",
    "\"Well, hardly that.  But there are not many #VBZ# to beat us.\"",
    "\"We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a\r\n#NN#.  I will tell you how the land lies, Watson.  You recollect how\r\nannoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\"",
    "\"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical\r\nanalysis.  One of our greatest #NNS# has said that a change of work\r\nis the best rest.  So it is.  When I had succeeded in dissolving the\r\n#NN# which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the\r\n#NNS#, and thought the whole matter out again.  My boys had been up\r\nthe river and down the river without result.  The launch was not at any\r\nlanding-stage or wharf, nor had it returned.  Yet it could hardly have\r\nbeen scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remained as a\r\npossible hypothesis if all else failed.  I knew this man Small had a\r\ncertain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of\r\nanything in the nature of delicate #NN#.  That is usually a product\r\nof higher education.  I then reflected that since he had certainly been\r\nin London some #NNS# we had evidence that he maintained a continual\r\nwatch over Pondicherry #NN# could hardly leave at a moment's\r\nnotice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to\r\narrange his affairs.  That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\"",
    "\"It seems to me to be a little weak,\" said I.  \"It is more probable\r\nthat he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his\r\nexpedition.\"",
    "\"No, I hardly think so.  This lair of his would be too valuable a\r\nretreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he\r\ncould do without it.  But a second consideration struck me.  Jonathan\r\nSmall must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,\r\nhowever much he may have #VBN# him, would give rise to gossip, and\r\npossibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy.  He was quite sharp\r\nenough to see that.  They had started from their #NNS# under\r\ncover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad\r\nlight.  Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when\r\nthey got the boat.  It would be quite bright, and people would be about\r\nin an hour or so.  Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far.  They\r\npaid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final\r\nescape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a\r\ncouple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,\r\nand whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under\r\ncover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no\r\ndoubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the\r\n#NNS#.\"",
    "\"But the launch?  They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\"",
    "\"Quite so.  I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite\r\nof its #NN#.  I then put myself in the place of Small, and\r\nlooked at it as a man of his capacity would.  He would probably\r\nconsider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would\r\nmake pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track.  How,\r\nthen, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted?\r\nI wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes.  I could\r\nonly think of one way of doing it.  I might land the launch over to\r\nsome #NN# or #NN#, with directions to make a trifling\r\nchange in her.  She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so\r\nbe #RB# concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a\r\nfew hours' notice.\"",
    "\"That seems simple enough.\"",
    "\"It is just these very simple things which are extremely #JJ# to be\r\noverlooked.  However, I determined to act on the idea.  I started at\r\nonce in this harmless #NN#'s #NN# and #VBD# at all the yards down\r\nthe river.  I drew blank at fifteen, but at the\r\n#NN#'#NN# learned that the Aurora had been handed over\r\nto them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial\r\ndirections as to her rudder.  'There ain't #NN# amiss with her\r\nrudder,' said the #NN#.  'There she lies, with the red streaks.'  At\r\nthat moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner?\r\nHe was rather the worse for #NN#.  I should not, of course, have\r\nknown him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch.  'I\r\nwant her to-night at eight o'clock,' said he,--'eight o'clock sharp,\r\nmind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting.'  They had\r\nevidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, #VBG#\r\nshillings about to the men.  I followed him some distance, but he\r\nsubsided into an #NN#:  so I went back to the yard, and, happening\r\nto pick up one of my boys on the way, I #VBN# him as a #NN# over\r\nthe launch.  He is to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief\r\nto us when they start.  We shall be lying off in the stream, and it\r\nwill be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\"",
    "\"You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or\r\nnot,\" said Jones; \"but if the affair were in my hands I should have had\r\na body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came\r\ndown.\"",
    "\"Which would have been never.  This man Small is a pretty shrewd\r\nfellow.  He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him\r\nsuspicious lie #JJ# for another week.\"",
    "\"But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their\r\nhiding-place,\" said I.",
    "\"In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred\r\nto one against Smith knowing where they live.  As long as he has liquor\r\nand good pay, why should he ask questions?  They send him messages what\r\nto do.  No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\"",
    "While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the\r\nlong series of #NNS# which span the Thames.  As we passed the #NNP#\r\nthe last #NNS# of the sun were #VBG# the cross upon the summit of St.\r\nPaul's.  It was twilight before we reached the Tower.",
    "\"That is Jacobson's Yard,\" said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of #NNS#\r\nand #VBG# on the Surrey side.  \"#NNP# gently up and down here under\r\ncover of this string of #NNS#.\"  He took a pair of #NN#\r\nfrom his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \"I see my sentry at\r\nhis post,\" he remarked, \"but no sign of a handkerchief.\"",
    "\"Suppose we go #NN# a short way and lie in wait for them,\" said\r\nJones, eagerly.  We were all eager by this time, even the #NNS# and\r\n#NN#, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.",
    "\"We have no right to take anything for granted,\" Holmes answered. \"It\r\nis certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be\r\ncertain.  From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they\r\ncan hardly see us.  It will be a clear night and plenty of light.  We\r\nmust stay where we are.  See how the folk swarm over yonder in the\r\n#NN#.\"",
    "\"They are coming from work in the yard.\"",
    "\"#VBG# rascals, but I suppose every one has some little\r\n#JJ# #VB# concealed about him.  You would not think it, to look at\r\nthem.  There is no a #FW# probability about it.  A strange #NN# is\r\nman!\"",
    "\"Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\" I suggested.",
    "\"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,\" said Holmes.  \"He remarks\r\nthat, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the #JJ#\r\nhe becomes a #JJ# certainty.  You can, for example, never\r\nforetell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what\r\nan average number will be up to.  Individuals vary, but #NNS#\r\nremain constant.  So says the #NN#. But do I see a\r\nhandkerchief?  Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\"",
    "\"Yes, it is your boy,\" I cried.  \"I can see him plainly.\"",
    "\"And there is the Aurora,\" exclaimed Holmes, \"and going like the devil!\r\nFull speed ahead, #NN#.  Make after that launch with the yellow\r\nlight.  By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have\r\nthe heels of us!\"",
    "She had slipped unseen through the #NN# and passed behind two\r\nor three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we\r\nsaw her.  Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,\r\ngoing at a tremendous rate.  Jones looked gravely at her and shook his\r\nhead.",
    "\"She is very fast,\" he said.  \"I doubt if we shall catch her.\"",
    "\"We MUST catch her!\" cried Holmes, between his teeth.  \"#NN# it on,\r\nstokers!  Make her do all she can!  If we #VB# the boat we must have\r\nthem!\"",
    "We were fairly after her now.  The furnaces roared, and the powerful\r\nengines #VBD# and #VBN#, like a great metallic heart.  Her sharp,\r\nsteep #NN# cut through the #NN# and sent two rolling waves to\r\nright and to left of us.  With every throb of the engines we sprang and\r\nquivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows\r\nthrew a long, #VBG# funnel of light in front of us.  Right ahead a\r\ndark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of\r\nwhite foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going.  We\r\nflashed past barges, steamers, #NN#, in and out, behind\r\nthis one and round the other.  #NNS# hailed us out of the darkness,\r\nbut still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her\r\ntrack.",
    "\"#NNP# it on, men, pile it on!\" cried Holmes, looking down into the\r\n#NN#, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,\r\naquiline face.  \"Get every pound of steam you can.\"",
    "\"I think we gain a little,\" said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.",
    "\"I am sure of it,\" said I.  \"We shall be up with her in a very few\r\nminutes.\"",
    "At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a #NN# with\r\nthree barges in #NN# blundered in between us.  It was only by putting\r\nour #NN# hard down that we avoided a #NN#, and before we could\r\nround them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred\r\nyards.  She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain\r\ntwilight was setting into a clear starlit night.  Our #NNS# were\r\nstrained to their utmost, and the frail shell #VBD# and creaked with\r\nthe fierce energy which was driving us along.  We had shot through the\r\n#NNP#, past the West India #NNS#, down the long #NN# #NNP#, and up\r\nagain after rounding the #NNP# of #NNS#.  The dull blur in front of us\r\nresolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora.  Jones\r\nturned our #NN# upon her, so that we could plainly see the\r\nfigures upon her deck.  One man sat by the stern, with something black\r\nbetween his knees over which he stooped.  Beside him lay a dark mass\r\nwhich looked like a #NNP# dog.  The boy held the #NN#, while\r\nagainst the red glare of the #NN# I could see old Smith, #VBN# to\r\nthe waist, and #VBG# coals for dear life.  They may have had some\r\ndoubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as\r\nwe followed every winding and turning which they took there could no\r\nlonger be any question about it.  At Greenwich we were about three\r\nhundred paces behind them.  At #NN# we could not have been more\r\nthan two hundred and fifty.  I have #VBN# many creatures in many\r\ncountries during my #VBN# career, but never did sport give me such\r\na wild thrill as this mad, flying #NN# down the Thames.  #RB#\r\nwe drew in upon them, yard by yard.  In the silence of the night we\r\ncould hear the panting and clanking of their #NN#.  The man in the\r\nstern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though\r\nhe were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure\r\nwith a glance the distance which still separated us.  #JJR# we came\r\nand nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop.  We were not more than four\r\nboat's #NNS# behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace.  It\r\nwas a clear reach of the river, with #VBG# #NNP# upon one side and\r\nthe melancholy #NN# #NNP# upon the other.  At our #NN# the man\r\nin the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two #VBD# fists\r\nat us, #VBG# the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,\r\npowerful man, and as he stood #VBG# himself with legs #IN# I could\r\nsee that from the #NN# downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the\r\nright side.  At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was\r\nmovement in the huddled bundle upon the deck.  It #VBD# itself\r\ninto a little black man--the smallest I have ever #NN# a great,\r\nmisshapen head and a shock of tangled, #VBN# hair.  Holmes had\r\nalready drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this\r\nsavage, distorted creature.  He was wrapped in some sort of dark #NN#\r\nor #NN#, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough\r\nto give a man a #JJ# night.  Never have I seen features so deeply\r\nmarked with all #NN# and #NN#.  His small eyes glowed and\r\nburned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from\r\nhis teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.",
    "\"#NNP# if he #VBZ# his hand,\" said Holmes, quietly.  We were within a\r\nboat'#NN# by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry.  I\r\ncan see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs\r\nfar apart, #VBG# out #NNS#, and the #VBN# dwarf with his\r\nhideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light\r\nof our lantern.",
    "It was well that we had so clear a view of him.  Even as we looked he\r\nplucked out from under his #VBG# a short, round piece of wood, like\r\na #NN#, and clapped it to his lips. Our #NNS# rang out\r\ntogether.  He #VBD# round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of\r\nchoking cough fell sideways into the stream.  I caught one glimpse of\r\nhis venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters.  At the\r\nsame moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put\r\nit hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank,\r\nwhile we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet.  We were\r\nround after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.\r\nIt was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide\r\n#NN# of #NN#, with pools of stagnant water and beds of\r\ndecaying vegetation.  The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the\r\n#NN#, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.\r\nThe fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length\r\ninto the sodden soil.  In vain he struggled and writhed.  Not one step\r\ncould he possibly take either forwards or backwards.  He yelled in\r\nimpotent rage, and #VBD# frantically into the mud with his other foot,\r\nbut his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky\r\nbank.  When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored\r\nthat it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that\r\nwe were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish,\r\nover our side.  The two #NNPS#, father and son, sat sullenly in their\r\nlaunch, but came aboard #RB# enough when commanded.  The Aurora\r\nherself we #VBD# off and made fast to our stern.  A solid iron chest\r\nof Indian #NN# stood upon the deck.  This, there could be no\r\nquestion, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of\r\nthe Sholtos.  There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so\r\nwe #VBN# it carefully to our own little #NN#.  As we steamed\r\nslowly #NN# again, we flashed our search-light in every direction,\r\nbut there was no sign of the Islander.  #RB# in the dark #NN# at\r\nthe bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our\r\nshores.",
    "\"See here,\" said Holmes, pointing to the wooden #NN#.  \"We were\r\nhardly quick enough with our pistols.\"  There, sure enough, just behind\r\nwhere we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we\r\nknew so well.  It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we\r\nfired.  Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy\r\nfashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible\r\ndeath which had passed so close to us that night.",
    "Chapter XI",
    "The Great Agra #NNP#",
    "Our #JJ# sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done\r\nso much and waited so long to gain.  He was a sunburned, #VBN#\r\nfellow, with a #NN# of lines and #NNS# all over his mahogany\r\nfeatures, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular\r\n#NN# about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be\r\neasily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or\r\nthereabouts, for his black, #RB# hair was thickly shot with gray.  His\r\nface in repose was not an #VBG# one, though his heavy brows and\r\naggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression\r\nwhen moved to anger.  He sat now with his #VBN# hands upon his\r\nlap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen,\r\ntwinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his #NNS#.\r\nIt seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and\r\ncontained countenance.  Once he looked up at me with a gleam of\r\nsomething like humor in his eyes.",
    "\"Well, Jonathan Small,\" said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \"I am sorry that\r\nit has come to this.\"",
    "\"And so am I, sir,\" he answered, frankly.  \"I don't believe that I can\r\nswing over the job.  I give you my word on the book that I never raised\r\nhand against Mr. Sholto.  It was that little #NN# #NN# who shot\r\none of his cursed darts into him.  I had no part in it, sir.  I was as\r\ngrieved as if it had been my #NN#.  I #VBN# the little devil\r\nwith the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not\r\nundo it again.\"",
    "\"Have a cigar,\" said Holmes; \"and you had best take a pull out of my\r\nflask, for you are very wet.  How could you expect so small and weak a\r\nman as this black fellow to #VB# Mr. Sholto and hold him while you\r\nwere climbing the rope?\"",
    "\"You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth\r\nis that I hoped to find the room clear.  I knew the habits of the house\r\npretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to\r\nhis supper.  I shall make no secret of the business.  The best defence\r\nthat I can make is just the simple truth.  Now, if it had been the old\r\nmajor I would have swung for him with a light heart.  I would have\r\nthought no more of #VBG# him than of smoking this cigar.  But it's\r\ncursed hard that I should be #VBN# over this young Sholto, with whom I\r\nhad no quarrel whatever.\"",
    "\"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard.  He\r\nis going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true\r\naccount of the matter.  You must make a clean breast of it, for if you\r\ndo I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the\r\npoison #NNS# so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached\r\nthe room.\"",
    "\"That he was, sir.  I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw\r\nhim grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through\r\nthe window.  It fairly shook me, sir.  I'd have half killed Tonga for\r\nit if he had not scrambled off.  That was how he came to leave his\r\nclub, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say\r\nhelped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than\r\nI can tell.  I don't feel no malice against you for it.  But it does\r\nseem a queer thing,\" he added, with a bitter smile, \"that I who have a\r\nfair claim to #RB# upon half a million of money should spend the first\r\nhalf of my life building a #NN# in the Andamans, and am like to\r\nspend the other half #VBG# #NNS# at #NN#.  It was an evil day\r\nfor me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant #NN# and had to do\r\nwith the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet\r\nupon the man who owned it.  To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto\r\nit brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant #NN# for life.\"",
    "At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders\r\ninto the tiny cabin.  \"Quite a family party,\" he remarked.  \"I think I\r\nshall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all\r\n#NN# each other.  #NNP# we didn't take the other alive; but\r\nthere was no choice.  I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it\r\nrather fine.  It was all we could do to #NN# her.\"",
    "\"All is well that ends well,\" said Holmes.  \"But I certainly did not\r\nknow that the Aurora was such a clipper.\"",
    "\"Smith says she is one of the #JJS# launches on the river, and that\r\nif he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never\r\nhave caught her.  He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\"",
    "\"Neither he did,\" cried our prisoner,--\"not a word.  I chose his launch\r\nbecause I heard that she was a #NN#.  We told him nothing, but we paid\r\nhim well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our\r\nvessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the #NNS#.\"",
    "\"Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him.\r\nIf we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in\r\n#VBG# them.\"  It was amusing to notice how the #JJ# Jones\r\nwas already beginning to give himself #NNS# on the strength of the\r\ncapture.  From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's\r\nface, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.",
    "\"We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\" said Jones, \"and shall land\r\nyou, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box.  I need hardly tell you that I\r\nam taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this.  It is\r\nmost irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement.  I must,\r\nhowever, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you\r\nhave so valuable a charge.  You will drive, no doubt?\"",
    "\"Yes, I shall drive.\"",
    "\"It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an #NN# first.\r\nYou will have to break it open.  Where is the key, my man?\"",
    "\"At the bottom of the river,\" said Small, shortly.",
    "\"Hum!  There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble.  We have\r\nhad work enough already through you.  However, doctor, I need not warn\r\nyou to be careful.  Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street\r\nrooms.  You will find us there, on our way to the station.\"",
    "They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,\r\ngenial inspector as my companion.  A quarter of an hour's drive brought\r\nus to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.  The servant seemed surprised at so late\r\na visitor.  Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she\r\nexplained, and likely to be very late.  Miss Morstan, however, was in\r\nthe drawing-room:  so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving\r\nthe #JJ# inspector in the cab.",
    "She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white\r\n#JJ# material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and\r\nwaist.  The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned\r\nback in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and\r\n#VBG# with a dull, metallic #NN# the rich coils of her luxuriant\r\nhair.  One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and\r\nher whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy.  At the\r\nsound of my #NN# she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright\r\nflush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.",
    "\"I heard a cab drive up,\" she said.  \"I thought that Mrs. Forrester had\r\ncome back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.  What\r\nnews have you brought me?\"",
    "\"I have brought something better than news,\" said I, putting down the\r\nbox upon the table and speaking #RB# and #RB#, though my\r\nheart was heavy within me.  \"I have brought you something which is\r\nworth all the news in the world.  I have brought you a fortune.\"",
    "She glanced at the iron box.  \"Is that the treasure, then?\" she asked,\r\n#RB# enough.",
    "\"Yes, this is the great Agra treasure.  Half of it is yours and half is\r\nThaddeus Sholto's.  You will have a couple of hundred thousand each.\r\nThink of that!  An #NN# of ten thousand pounds.  There will be few\r\nricher young ladies in England.  Is it not glorious?\"",
    "I think that I must have been rather #VBG# my delight, and that\r\nshe detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her\r\neyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.",
    "\"If I have it,\" said she, \"I owe it to you.\"",
    "\"No, no,\" I answered, \"not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.\r\nWith all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue\r\nwhich has #VBN# even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly\r\nlost it at the last moment.\"",
    "\"Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\" said she.",
    "I #VBN# briefly what had occurred since I had seen her\r\nlast,#NNS#'s new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the\r\nappearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the\r\nwild chase down the Thames.  She listened with parted lips and shining\r\neyes to my #JJ# of our adventures.  When I spoke of the dart which\r\nhad so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she\r\nwas about to faint.",
    "\"It is nothing,\" she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.\r\n\"I am all right again.  It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed\r\nmy friends in such horrible peril.\"",
    "\"That is all over,\" I answered.  \"It was nothing.  I will tell you no\r\nmore gloomy details.  Let us turn to something brighter. There is the\r\ntreasure.  What could be brighter than that?  I got leave to bring it\r\nwith me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\"",
    "\"It would be of the greatest interest to me,\" she said.  There was no\r\neagerness in her voice, however.  It had struck her, doubtless, that it\r\nmight seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which\r\nhad cost so much to win.",
    "\"What a pretty box!\" she said, stooping over it.  \"This is Indian work,\r\nI suppose?\"",
    "\"Yes; it is #NNS# #NN#.\"",
    "\"And so heavy!\" she exclaimed, trying to raise it.  \"The box alone must\r\nbe of some value.  Where is the key?\"",
    "\"Small threw it into the Thames,\" I answered.  \"I must #VB# Mrs.\r\nForrester's #NN#.\"  There was in the front a thick and broad #NN#,\r\nwrought in the image of a sitting #NNP#.  Under this I thrust the end\r\nof the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open\r\nwith a loud snap.  With trembling fingers I flung back the lid.  We\r\nboth stood gazing in astonishment.  The box was empty!",
    "No wonder that it was heavy.  The #NN# was two-thirds of an inch\r\nthick all round.  It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest\r\nconstructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or #NN#\r\nof metal or #NN# lay within it.  It was absolutely and completely\r\nempty.",
    "\"The treasure is lost,\" said Miss Morstan, calmly.",
    "As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow\r\nseemed to pass from my soul.  I did not know how this Agra treasure had\r\nweighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.  It was\r\nselfish, no doubt, #JJ#, wrong, but I could realize nothing save\r\nthat the golden barrier was gone from between us.  \"Thank God!\" I\r\nejaculated from my very heart.",
    "She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile.  \"Why do you say\r\nthat?\" she asked.",
    "\"Because you are within my reach again,\" I said, taking her hand. She\r\ndid not withdraw it.  \"Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man\r\nloved a woman.  Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips.\r\nNow that they are gone I can tell you how I love you.  That is why I\r\nsaid, 'Thank God.'\"",
    "\"Then I say, 'Thank God,' too,\" she whispered, as I drew her to my\r\nside.  Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained\r\none.",

    "The Strange Story of Jonathan Small",
    "A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary\r\ntime before I rejoined him.  His face #VBN# over when I showed him\r\nthe empty box.",
    "\"There goes the reward!\" said he, gloomily.  \"Where there is no money\r\nthere is no #NN#.  This night's work would have been worth a #NN# each\r\nto Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\"",
    "\"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\" I said.  \"He will see that you are\r\n#VBN#, treasure or no.\"",
    "The inspector shook his head #RB#, however.  \"It's a bad job,\"\r\nhe repeated; \"and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\"",
    "His #NN# proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank\r\nenough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They\r\nhad only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had\r\nchanged their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon\r\nthe way.  My companion #VBD# in his arm-chair with his usual listless\r\nexpression, while Small sat #RB# opposite to him with his wooden\r\nleg cocked over his sound one.  As I exhibited the empty box he leaned\r\nback in his chair and laughed aloud.",
    "\"This is your doing, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, angrily.",
    "\"Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\" he\r\ncried, exultantly.  \"It is my treasure; and if I can't have the #NN#\r\nI'll take #RB# good care that no one else does.  I tell you that no\r\nliving man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the\r\nAndaman convict-barracks and myself.  I know now that I cannot have the\r\nuse of it, and I know that they cannot.  I have acted all through for\r\nthem as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always.\r\nWell I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and\r\nthrow the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to #NN# or #NN#\r\nof Sholto or of Morstan.  It was not to make them rich that we did for\r\nAchmet.  You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little\r\nTonga is.  When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot\r\naway in a safe place.  There are no #NNS# for you this journey.\"",
    "\"You are deceiving us, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, sternly.  \"If you\r\nhad wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been\r\neasier for you to have thrown box and all.\"",
    "\"#JJR# for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\" he answered,\r\nwith a shrewd, #JJ# look.  \"The man that was clever enough to hunt\r\nme down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a\r\nriver.  Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a\r\nharder job.  It went to my heart to do it, though.  I was half mad when\r\nyou came up with us.  However, there's no good #VBG# over it.  I've\r\nhad #NNS# in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry\r\nover spilled milk.\"",
    "\"This is a very serious matter, Small,\" said the detective.  \"If you\r\nhad helped justice, instead of #VBG# it in this way, you would have\r\nhad a better chance at your trial.\"",
    "\"Justice!\" snarled the #NN#.  \"A pretty justice!  #WP$# loot is\r\nthis, if it is not ours?  Where is the justice that I should give it up\r\nto those who have never earned it?  Look how I have earned it!  Twenty\r\nlong years in that #NN# swamp, all day at work under the\r\n#NN#, all night #VBD# up in the filthy #NNS#, bitten\r\nby mosquitoes, #VBN# with ague, #VBD# by every cursed #VBN#\r\npoliceman who loved to take it out of a white man.  That was how I\r\nearned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I\r\ncannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may\r\nenjoy it!  I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of\r\nTonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that\r\nanother man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be\r\nmine.\" Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this #NN# out in\r\na wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked\r\ntogether with the #JJ# movement of his hands.  I could\r\nunderstand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was\r\nno #JJ# or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when\r\nhe first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.",
    "\"You forget that we know nothing of all this,\" said Holmes quietly.\r\n\"We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may\r\noriginally have been on your side.\"",
    "\"Well, sir, you have been very #NN# to me, though I can see that\r\nI have you to thank that I have these #NNS# upon my wrists.  Still,\r\nI bear no grudge for that.  It is all fair and above-board.  If you\r\nwant to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you\r\nis God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass\r\nbeside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.",
    "\"I am a #JJ# man myself,#NN# near #NN#.  I dare say you\r\nwould find a heap of #NNS# living there now if you were to look.  I\r\nhave often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that\r\nI was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would\r\nbe so very glad to see me.  They were all steady, #VBG# folk,\r\nsmall #NNS#, well known and respected over the country-side, while I\r\nwas always a bit of a #NN#.  At last, however, when I was about\r\neighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a\r\ngirl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling\r\nand joining the 3d #NNS#, which was just starting for India.",
    "\"I wasn't destined to do much #VBG#, however.  I had just got past\r\nthe #NN#, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough\r\nto go #VBG# in the #NNP#.  #RB# for me, my company sergeant,\r\nJohn #NN#, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the\r\nfinest #NNS# in the service.  A crocodile took me, just as I was\r\nhalf-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon\r\ncould have done it, just above the knee.  What with the shock and the\r\nloss of blood, I fainted, and should have #VBN# if Holder had not\r\ncaught hold of me and #VBN# for the bank. I was five months in\r\n#JJ# over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with\r\nthis #NN# toe strapped to my stump I found myself #VBN# out of\r\nthe army and #VBN# for any active occupation.",
    "\"I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I\r\nwas a useless #VB# though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my\r\nmisfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named\r\n#NN#, who had come out there as an #NN#, wanted an\r\n#NN# to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work.  He\r\nhappened to be a friend of our #NN#'s, who had taken an interest in\r\nme since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel\r\nrecommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be\r\ndone on #NN#, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee\r\nleft to keep good grip on the #NN#.  What I had to do was to #VB#\r\nover the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to\r\nreport the #NNS#.  The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and\r\naltogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in\r\n#VBG#.  Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop\r\ninto my little #NN# and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out\r\nthere feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at\r\nhome.",
    "\"Well, I was never in luck's way long.  Suddenly, without a note of\r\nwarning, the great #NN# broke upon us.  One month India lay as still\r\nand peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were\r\ntwo hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a\r\nperfect hell.  Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more\r\nthan I do, very like, since reading is not in my line.  I only know\r\nwhat I saw with my own eyes.  Our plantation was at a place called\r\n#NN#, near the border of the #NNP# #NNP#.  #NNP# after night\r\nthe whole sky was alight with the burning #NNS#, and day after day\r\nwe had small #NNS# of Europeans passing through our #NN# with\r\ntheir #NNS# and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest\r\ntroops.  Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man.  He had it in his head\r\nthat the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would #VB# over as\r\nsuddenly as it had sprung up.  There he sat on his veranda, drinking\r\n#NN# and smoking #NNS#, while the country was in a blaze\r\nabout him.  Of course we stuck by him, I and #NNP#, who, with his\r\nwife, used to do the #NN# and the #VBG#.  Well, one fine day\r\nthe crash came.  I had been away on a distant plantation, and was\r\nriding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all\r\nhuddled together at the bottom of a steep #NN#.  I #VBD# down to see\r\nwhat it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was\r\nDawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and\r\nnative dogs.  A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on\r\nhis face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four\r\n#NNS# lying across each other in front of him.  I #VBD# up my horse,\r\nwondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke\r\n#VBG# up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst\r\nthrough the roof.  I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but\r\nwould only throw my own life away if I #NN# in the matter.  From\r\nwhere I stood I could see hundreds of the black #NNS#, with their red\r\n#NNS# still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning\r\nhouse.  Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past\r\nmy head; so I broke away across the #NNS#, and found myself late\r\nat night safe within the walls at Agra.",
    "\"As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The\r\nwhole country was up like a swarm of bees.  Wherever the English could\r\ncollect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns\r\ncommanded.  Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives.  It was a\r\nfight of the millions against the hundreds; and the #NN# part of\r\nit was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and #NNS#,\r\nwere our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling\r\nour own weapons, and blowing our own #NNS#.  At Agra there were\r\nthe 3d Bengal #NN#, some #NNPS#, two troops of horse, and a battery\r\nof #NN#.  A #NN# #NNS# of #NNS# and #NNS# had been\r\nformed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all.  We went out to meet the\r\nrebels at #NN# early in July, and we beat them back for a time,\r\nbut our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.\r\nNothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--which is not to\r\nbe wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were\r\nright in the heart of it.  #NN# is rather better than a hundred\r\nmiles to the east, and #NN# about as far to the south.  From every\r\npoint on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and\r\noutrage.",
    "\"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with #NNS# and fierce\r\n#NN# of all sorts.  Our handful of men were lost among the\r\nnarrow, winding streets.  Our leader moved across the river, therefore,\r\nand took up his position in the old fort at Agra.  I don't know if any\r\nof you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort.  It\r\nis a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in, and I have\r\nbeen in some #NN# corners, too.  First of all, it is enormous in size.\r\nI should think that the enclosure must be #NNS# and acres.  There is a\r\nmodern part, which took all our #NN#, women, children, stores, and\r\neverything else, with plenty of room over.  But the modern part is\r\nnothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which\r\nis given over to the #NN# and the #NNS#.  It is all full of\r\ngreat deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting\r\nin and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it.  For\r\nthis reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and\r\nagain a party with torches might go exploring.",
    "\"The river #NNS# along the front of the old fort, and so #VBZ# it,\r\nbut on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be\r\nguarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was\r\nactually held by our troops.  We were #VBN#, with hardly men\r\nenough to man the #NNS# of the building and to serve the guns.  It was\r\nimpossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of\r\nthe innumerable gates.  What we did was to #VB# a central\r\nguard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the\r\ncharge of one white man and two or three natives.  I was selected to\r\ntake charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door\r\nupon the #RB# side of the building.  Two #NNP# #NNS# were placed\r\nunder my command, and I was #VBN# if anything went wrong to fire\r\nmy musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central\r\nguard.  As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as\r\nthe space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and\r\ncorridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time\r\nto be of any use in case of an actual attack.",
    "\"Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since\r\nI was a raw #VB#, and a #VBN# one at that.  For two nights I\r\nkept the watch with my #NNS#.  They were tall, #VBG#\r\nchaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old #NN#\r\nwho had borne arms against us at #NN#.  They could talk\r\nEnglish pretty well, but I could get little out of them.  They\r\npreferred to stand together and #NN# all night in their queer Sikh\r\n#NN#.  For myself, I used to stand outside the #NN#, looking down\r\non the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great\r\ncity.  The beating of drums, the rattle of #NNS#, and the yells and\r\n#NNS# of the rebels, #JJ# with opium and with #NN#, were enough to\r\nremind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream.\r\nEvery two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the\r\nposts, to make sure that all was well.",
    "\"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving\r\nrain.  It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in\r\nsuch weather.  I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but\r\nwithout much success.  At two in the morning the rounds passed, and\r\nbroke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my\r\ncompanions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and\r\nlaid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs\r\nwere upon me.  One of them snatched my #NN# up and #VBN# it at\r\nmy head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore\r\nbetween his teeth that he would #VB# it into me if I moved a step.",
    "\"My first thought was that these fellows were in #NN# with the\r\n#NN#s, and that this was the beginning of an assault.  If our door\r\nwere in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and\r\nchildren be treated as they were in Cawnpore.  #RB# you gentlemen\r\nthink that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my\r\nword that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife\r\nat my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream,\r\nif it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard.  The man who\r\nheld me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it,\r\nhe whispered, 'Don't make a noise.  The fort is safe enough.  There are\r\nno rebel dogs on this side of the river.'  There was the ring of truth\r\nin what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man.\r\nI could read it in the fellow's brown eyes.  I waited, therefore, in\r\nsilence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.",
    "\"'Listen to me, Sahib,' said the taller and #JJR# of the pair, the\r\none whom they called Abdullah Khan.  'You must either be with us now or\r\nyou must be #VBN# forever.  The thing is too great a one for us to\r\nhesitate.  Either you are heart and soul with us on your #NN# on the\r\ncross of the #NNPS#, or your body this night shall be thrown into\r\nthe #NN# and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army.\r\nThere is no middle way.  Which is it to be, death or life?  We can only\r\ngive you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must\r\nbe done before the rounds come again.'",
    "\"'How can I decide?' said I.  'You have not told me what you want of\r\nme.  But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of\r\nthe fort I will have no #NN# with it, so you can drive home your knife\r\nand welcome.'",
    "\"'It is nothing against the fort,' said he.  'We only ask you to do\r\nthat which your countrymen come to this land for.  We ask you to be\r\nrich.  If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon\r\nthe naked knife, and by the #JJ# oath which no Sikh was ever known\r\nto break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot.  A quarter\r\nof the treasure shall be yours.  We can say no #JJR#.'",
    "\"'But what is the treasure, then?' I asked.  'I am as ready to be rich\r\nas you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.'",
    "\"'You will swear, then,' said he, 'by the bones of your father, by the\r\nhonor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and\r\nspeak no word against us, either now or afterwards?'",
    "\"'I will swear it,' I answered, 'provided that the fort is not\r\n#VBN#.'",
    "\"'Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the\r\ntreasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.'",
    "\"'There are but three,' said I.",
    "\"'No; Dost Akbar must have his share.  We can tell the tale to you\r\nwhile we await them.  Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give\r\nnotice of their coming.  The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to\r\nyou because I know that an oath is binding upon a #NN#, and that\r\nwe may trust you.  Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by\r\nall the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon\r\nthe knife, and your body in the water.  But the Sikh knows the\r\nEnglishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh.  #NN#, then, to what\r\nI have to say.",
    "\"'There is a rajah in the #JJ# provinces who has much wealth,\r\nthough his lands are small.  #RB# has come to him from his father, and\r\nmore still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and #NNS#\r\nhis gold rather than spend it.  When the troubles broke out he would be\r\nfriends both with the #NN# and the tiger,#NN# the #NN# and with the\r\nCompany's #NNP#.  Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men's\r\nday was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of\r\ntheir death and their #VB#.  Yet, being a careful man, he made\r\nsuch plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should\r\nbe left to him.  That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in\r\nthe #NNS# of his palace, but the most precious stones and the #JJS#\r\npearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty\r\nservant who, under the #NN# of a merchant, should take it to the fort\r\nat Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels\r\nwon he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels\r\nwould be saved to him.  Having thus divided his #NN#, he threw himself\r\ninto the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders.\r\nBy doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those\r\nwho have been true to their salt.",

Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a\r\n#NN# of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose.\r\nHere he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and\r\nmyself awaiting him.  The place is lonely, and none shall know of his\r\ncoming.  The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the\r\ngreat treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us.

Whether Achmet the\r\nmerchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the\r\ntalk about the treasure my heart tur#FW#d to it, and I thought of what I\r\nmight do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when\r\nthey saw their ne'#NN# coming back with his pockets full of gold\r\n#NNS#.  I had, therefore, already made up my mind.  Abdullah Khan,\r\nhowever, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.",
    "\"'Consider, Sahib,' said he, 'that if this man is taken by the\r\n#NN# he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the\r\ngovernment, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now,\r\nsince we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?\r\nThe jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's #NNS#.  There\r\nwill be enough to make every one of us rich men and great #NNS#.  No\r\none can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.\r\nWhat could be better for the purpose?

    "\"'Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice.",

Outside of a show I have\r\nnever seen so tall a man.  The other was a little, fat, round fellow,\r\nwith a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a\r\nshawl.  He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands\r\ntwitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and\r\nright with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he\r\nventures out from his hole.  It gave me the #NNS# to think of killing\r\nhim, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint\r\nwithin me.

    "\"'An iron box,' he answered, 'which contains one or two little family\r\nmatters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to\r\nlose.  Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and\r\nyour #NN# also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.'",
    "\"I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man.  The more I\r\nlooked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we\r\nshould slay him in cold blood.  It was best to get it over.",
    "\"'Take him to the main guard,' said I.  The two Sikhs closed in upon\r\nhim on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in\r\nthrough the dark gate-way.  Never was a man so #VBN# round with\r\ndeath.  I remained at the gate-way with the lantern.",
    "\"I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps #VBG# through\r\nthe lonely corridors.  Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a\r\nscuffle, with the sound of blows.  A moment later there came, to my\r\nhorror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud\r\nbreathing of a running man.  I turned my lantern down the long,\r\nstraight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind,\r\nwith a #NN# of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding\r\nlike a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in\r\nhis hand.  I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant.\r\nHe was #VBG# on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me\r\nand got to the open air he would save himself yet.  My heart softened\r\nto him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and\r\nbitter.  I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he\r\nrolled twice over like a shot rabbit.  #IN# he could stagger to his feet\r\nthe Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side.  The man\r\nnever uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen.  I\r\nthink myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall.  You see,\r\ngentlemen, that I am keeping my promise.  I am telling you every work\r\nof the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favor\r\nor not.\"",
    "He stopped, and held out his #VBN# hands for the #NN#\r\nwhich Holmes had #VBN# for him.  For myself, I confess that I had now\r\nconceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this #JJ#\r\nbusiness in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat\r\n#JJ# and careless way in which he narrated it.  Whatever punishment\r\nwas in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.\r\nSherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply\r\ninterested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their\r\nfaces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in\r\nhis voice and manner as he proceeded.",
    "\"It was all very bad, no doubt,\" said he.  \"I should like to know how\r\nmany fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when\r\nthey knew that they would have their #NNS# cut for their pains.\r\nBesides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort.  If he had\r\ngot out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been\r\n#VBN# and shot as likely as not; for people were not very\r\n#JJ# at a time like that.\"",
    "\"Go on with your story,\" said Holmes, shortly.",
    "\"Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I.  A fine weight he\r\nwas, too, for all that he was so short.  Mahomet Singh was left to\r\nguard the door.  We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already\r\nprepared.  It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a\r\ngreat empty hall, the brick walls of which were all #VBG# to\r\npieces.  The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural\r\ngrave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him\r\nover with loose bricks.  This done, we all #NN# back to the treasure.",
    "\"It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked.  The box\r\nwas the same which now lies open upon your table.  A key was hung by a\r\n#JJ# cord to that #VBN# handle upon the top.  We opened it, and the\r\nlight of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have\r\nread of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore.  It was\r\n#JJ# to look upon them.  When we had #VBN# our eyes we took them\r\nall out and made a list of them.  There were one hundred and\r\nforty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been\r\ncalled, I believe, 'the Great #NNP#' and is said to be the second\r\nlargest stone in existence.  Then there were #NN# very fine\r\n#NNS#, and one hundred and seventy #NNS#, some of which, however,\r\nwere small.  There were forty #NNS#, two hundred and ten\r\n#NN#, #NN# #NNS#, and a great quantity of #NNS#, #NNS#,\r\ncats'#NNS#, #NN#, and other stones, the very names of which I did\r\nnot know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them\r\nsince.  Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls,\r\ntwelve of which were set in a gold #NN#.  By the way, these last had\r\nbeen taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.",
    "\"After we had #VBN# our treasures we put them back into the chest and\r\ncarried them to the gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh.  Then we\r\nsolemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our\r\nsecret.  We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the\r\ncountry should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among\r\nourselves.  There was no use #VBG# it at present, for if gems of\r\nsuch value were found upon us it would #VB# suspicion, and there was\r\nno privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them.  We\r\ncarried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the\r\nbody, and there, under certain bricks in the #JJ# wall, we\r\nmade a hollow and put our treasure.  We made careful note of the place,\r\nand next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of\r\nthe four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each\r\nalways act for all, so that none might take advantage.  That is an oath\r\nthat I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.",
    "\"Well, there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian\r\nmutiny.  After Wilson took #NNP# and Sir #NNP# relieved Lucknow the\r\nback of the business was broken.  Fresh troops came pouring in, and\r\n#NNP# Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under\r\nColonel #VBN# came round to Agra and cleared the #NNS# away from\r\nit.  #NNP# seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were\r\nbeginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off\r\nwith our shares of the #NN#.  In a moment, however, our hopes were\r\nshattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.",
    "\"It came about in this way.  When the rajah put his jewels into the\r\nhands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.\r\nThey are suspicious folk in the East, however:  so what does this rajah\r\ndo but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the\r\nspy upon the first?  This second man was ordered never to let Achmet\r\nout of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow.  He went after\r\nhim that night and saw him pass through the doorway.  Of course he\r\nthought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission\r\nthere himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet.  This seemed\r\nto him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who\r\nbrought it to the ears of the commandant.  A thorough search was\r\nquickly made, and the body was discovered.  Thus at the very moment\r\nthat we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought\r\nto trial on a charge of murder,#NN# of us because we had held the\r\ngate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in\r\nthe company of the murdered man.  Not a word about the jewels came out\r\nat the trial, for the rajah had been #VBN# and driven out of India:\r\nso no one had any particular interest in them.  The murder, however,\r\nwas clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been\r\nconcerned in it.  The three Sikhs got #JJ# #NN# for life, and I\r\nwas condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards #VBN# into\r\nthe same as the others.",
    "\"It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There\r\nwe were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of\r\never getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have\r\nput each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it.  It\r\nwas enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick\r\nand the #NN# of every petty #NN#, to have #NN# to eat and\r\nwater to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside,\r\njust waiting to be picked up.  It might have driven me mad; but I was\r\nalways a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.",
    "\"At last it seemed to me to have come.  I was changed from Agra to\r\n#NNS#, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans.  There are very\r\nfew white convicts at this #NN#, and, as I had behaved well from\r\nthe first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person.  I was\r\ngiven a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of #NNP#\r\n#NNP#, and I was left pretty much to myself.  It is a dreary,\r\n#NN# place, and all beyond our little clearings was #VBN#\r\nwith wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned\r\ndart at us if they saw a chance.  There was digging, and #VBG#, and\r\n#VBG#, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy\r\nenough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to\r\nourselves.  Among other things, I learned to dispense #NNS# for the\r\nsurgeon, and picked up a #VBG# of his knowledge.  All the time I\r\nwas on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles\r\nfrom any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas:  so\r\nit was a terribly difficult job to get away.",
    "\"The surgeon, Dr. #NN#, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the\r\nother young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play\r\ncards.  The #NN#, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his\r\nsitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt\r\nlonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then,\r\nstanding there, I could hear their talk and watch their play.  I am\r\nfond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one\r\nto watch the others.  There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and\r\n#NNP# #NNP# Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and\r\nthere was the surgeon himself, and two or three #NN#,\r\n#JJ# old hands who played a nice sly safe game.  A very snug little\r\nparty they used to make.",
    "\"Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that\r\nthe #NNS# used always to lose and the #NNS# to win.  #VB#, I\r\ndon't say that there was anything #JJ#, but so it was.  These\r\n#NN# had done little else than play cards ever since they had\r\nbeen at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point, while\r\nthe others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down\r\nanyhow.  Night after night the soldiers got up #JJR# men, and the\r\npoorer they got the more keen they were to play.  Major Sholto was the\r\n#JJS# hit.  He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it\r\ncame to notes of hand and for big #NNS#.  He sometimes would win for a\r\nfew #NNS#, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in\r\nagainst him worse than ever.  All day he would wander about as black as\r\nthunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.",
    "\"One night he lost even more heavily than usual.  I was sitting in my\r\nhut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to\r\ntheir quarters.  They were bosom friends, those two, and never far\r\napart.  The major was raving about his #NNS#.",
    "\"'It's all up, Morstan,' he was saying, as they passed my hut. 'I shall\r\nhave to send in my papers.  I am a ruined man.'",
    "\"'Nonsense, old chap!' said the other, #VBG# him upon the shoulder.\r\n'I've had a nasty #NN# myself, #NN#'  That was all I could hear, but\r\nit was enough to set me thinking.",
    "\"A couple of days later Major Sholto was #VBG# on the beach: so I\r\ntook the chance of speaking to him.",
    "\"'I wish to have your advice, major,' said I.",
    "\"'Well, Small, what is it?' he asked, taking his #NN# from his lips.",
    "\"'I wanted to ask you, sir,' said I, 'who is the proper person to whom\r\nhidden treasure should be handed over.  I know where half a million\r\nworth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best\r\nthing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper\r\nauthorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence #VBN# for\r\nme.'",
    "\"'Half a million, Small?' he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was\r\nin earnest.",
    "\"'Quite that, sir,#NN# jewels and pearls.  It lies there ready for any\r\none.  And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is #VBN#\r\nand cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first #NN#.'",
    "\"'To government, Small,' he stammered,--'to government.'  But he said\r\nit in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.",
    "\"'You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the\r\n#JJ#?' said I, quietly.",
    "\"'Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might #VB#.\r\nLet me hear all about it, Small.  Give me the facts.'",
    "\"I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not\r\n#VB# the places.  When I had finished he stood stock still and full\r\nof thought.  I could see by the #NN# of his lip that there was a\r\nstruggle going on within him.",
    "\"'This is a very important matter, Small,' he said, at last. 'You must\r\nnot say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.'",
    "\"Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in\r\nthe dead of the night with a lantern.",
    "\"'I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own\r\nlips, Small,' said he.",
    "\"I repeated it as I had told it before.",
    "\"'It rings true, eh?' said he.  'It's good enough to act upon?'",
    "\"Captain Morstan nodded.",
    "\"'Look here, Small,' said the major.  'We have been talking it over, my\r\nfriend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret\r\nof yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private\r\nconcern of your own, which of course you have the power of #VBG# of\r\nas you think best.  Now, the question is, what price would you ask for\r\nit?  We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if\r\nwe could agree as to terms.'  He tried to speak in a cool, careless\r\nway, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.",
    "\"'Why, as to that, gentlemen,' I answered, trying also to be cool, but\r\nfeeling as excited as he did, 'there is only one bargain which a man in\r\nmy position can make.  I shall want you to help me to my #NN#, and\r\nto help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into\r\n#NN#, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.'",
    "\"'Hum!' said he.  'A fifth share!  That is not very #JJ#.'",
    "\"'It would come to fifty thousand #RB#,' said I.",
    "\"'But how can we gain your freedom?  You know very well that you ask an\r\n#NN#.'",
    "\"'Nothing of the sort,' I answered.  'I have thought it all out to the\r\nlast detail.  The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit\r\nfor the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time.  There\r\nare plenty of little #NNS# and #NNS# at #NNP# or Madras which would\r\nserve our turn well.  Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get\r\naboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian\r\ncoast you will have done your part of the bargain.'",
    "\"'If there were only one,' he said.",
    "\"'None or all,' I answered.  'We have sworn it.  The four of us must\r\nalways act together.'",
    "\"'You see, Morstan,' said he, 'Small is a man of his word.  He does not\r\n#VB# from his friend.  I think we may very well trust him.'",
    "\"'It's a dirty business,' the other answered.  'Yet, as you say, the\r\nmoney would save our #NNS# handsomely.'",
    "\"'Well, Small,' said the major, 'we must, I suppose, try and meet you.\r\nWe must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where\r\nthe box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India\r\nin the #RB# #NN# to inquire into the affair.'",
    "\"'Not so fast,' said I, growing #JJR# as he got hot.  'I must have the\r\nconsent of my three comrades.  I tell you that it is four or none with\r\nus.'",
    "\"'Nonsense!' he broke in.  'What have three black fellows to do with\r\nour agreement?'",
    "\"'Black or blue,' said I, 'they are in with me, and we all go together.'",
    "\"Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh,\r\nAbdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present.  We talked the matter\r\nover again, and at last we came to an arrangement.  We were to #VB#\r\nboth the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the\r\nplace in the wall where the treasure was hid.  Major Sholto was to go\r\nto India to test our story.  If he found the box he was to leave it\r\nthere, to send out a small yacht #VBN# for a voyage, which was to\r\nlie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and\r\nfinally to return to his duties.  Captain Morstan was then to apply for\r\nleave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final\r\ndivision of the treasure, he taking the major's share as well as his\r\nown.  All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could\r\nthink or the lips utter.  I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by\r\nthe morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of\r\nfour,--that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.",
    "\"Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my\r\nfriend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in #NN#.  I'll\r\nmake it as short as I can.  The villain Sholto went off to India, but\r\nhe never came back again.  Captain Morstan showed me his name among a\r\nlist of passengers in one of the #NNS# very shortly afterwards.\r\nHis #NN# had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army,\r\nyet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us.  Morstan\r\nwent over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that\r\nthe treasure was indeed gone.  The #NN# had stolen it all, without\r\ncarrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.\r\nFrom that day I lived only for vengeance.  I thought of it by day and I\r\nnursed it by night.  It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with\r\nme.  I cared nothing for the law,--nothing for the #NNS#.  To escape,\r\nto track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,--that was my one\r\nthought.  Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my\r\nmind than the #VBG# of Sholto.",
    "\"Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one\r\nwhich I did not carry out.  But it was weary years before my time came.\r\nI have told you that I had picked up something of medicine.  One day\r\nwhen Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was\r\npicked up by a #NN# in the woods.  He was sick to death, and\r\nhad gone to a lonely place to die.  I took him in hand, though he was\r\nas venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him\r\nall right and able to walk.  He took a kind of fancy to me then, and\r\nwould hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut.\r\nI learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the\r\n#JJR# of me.",
    "\"#NN# that was his #NNS# a fine boatman, and owned a big,\r\n#JJ# canoe of his own.  When I found that he was devoted to me and\r\nwould do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it\r\nover with him.  He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an\r\nold wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up.  I\r\ngave him directions to have several #NNS# of water and a lot of #NNS#,\r\n#NNS#, and sweet #NNS#.",
    "\"He was stanch and true, was little Tonga.  No man ever had a more\r\nfaithful mate.  At the night named he had his boat at the wharf.  As it\r\nchanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,--a\r\nvile #NN# who had never missed a chance of #JJ# and injuring me.\r\nI had always #VBD# vengeance, and now I had my chance.  It was as if\r\nfate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left\r\nthe island.  He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his #NN#\r\non his shoulder.  I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains\r\nwith, but none could I see.  Then a queer thought came into my head and\r\nshowed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon.  I sat down in the\r\ndarkness and #VBN# my wooden leg.  With three long #VBZ# I was on\r\nhim.  He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and\r\nknocked the whole front of his skull in.  You can see the split in the\r\nwood now where I hit him.  We both went down together, for I could not\r\nkeep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet\r\nenough.  I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea.\r\nTonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and\r\nhis gods.  Among other things, he had a long bamboo #NN#, and some\r\nAndaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail.  For ten\r\ndays we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the #JJ# we\r\nwere picked up by a #NN# which was going from Singapore to #NN#\r\nwith a cargo of #NNP# #NNS#.  They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I\r\nsoon managed to settle down among them.  They had one very good\r\nquality:  they let you alone and asked no questions.",
    "\"Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little #NN# and\r\nI went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until\r\nthe sun was shining.  Here and there we drifted about the world,\r\nsomething always turning up to keep us from London.  All the time,\r\nhowever, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would #VB# of Sholto at\r\nnight.  A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep.  At last,\r\nhowever, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England.\r\nI had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to\r\nwork to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he still\r\nhad it.  I made friends with someone who could help me,--I name no\r\nnames, for I don't want to get any one else in a hole,--and I soon\r\nfound that he still had the jewels.  Then I tried to get at him in many\r\nways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides\r\nhis sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him.",
    "\"One day, however, I got word that he was dying.  I hurried at once to\r\nthe garden, mad that he should slip out of my #NNS# like that, and,\r\nlooking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons\r\non each side of him.  I'd have come through and taken my chance with\r\nthe three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I\r\nknew that he was gone.  I got into his room that same night, though,\r\nand I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he\r\nhad hidden our jewels.  There was not a line, however:  so I came away,\r\nbitter and savage as a man could be.  Before I left I #VB# me that\r\nif I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know\r\nthat I had left some mark of our hatred:  so I scrawled down the sign\r\nof the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his\r\nbosom.  It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without\r\nsome token from the men whom he had robbed and #VBN#.",
    "\"We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at #NNS#\r\nand other such places as the black cannibal.  He would eat raw meat and\r\ndance his #NN#:  so we always had a #NN# of #NNS# after a\r\nday's work.  I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for\r\nsome years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for\r\nthe treasure.  At last, however, came what we had waited for so long.\r\nThe treasure had been found.  It was up at the top of the house, in Mr.\r\nBartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory.  I came at once and had a\r\nlook at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to\r\nmake my way up to it.  I learned, however, about a trap-door in the\r\nroof, and also about Mr. Sholto's #NN#.  It seemed to me that I\r\ncould manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me\r\nwith a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and\r\nhe soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it,\r\nBartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost.  Tonga thought\r\nhe had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by\r\nthe rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock.  Very much\r\nsurprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him\r\nfor a little #JJ# imp.  I took the treasure-box and let it\r\ndown, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four\r\nupon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those\r\nwho had most right to them.  Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the\r\nwindow, and made off the way that he had come.",
    "\"I don't know that I have anything else to tell you.  I had heard a\r\n#NN# speak of the speed of Smith's launch the Aurora, so I thought\r\nshe would be a handy craft for our escape.

All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it\r\nis not to amuse you,#NN# you have not done me a very good turn,#NN#\r\nit is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold\r\nback nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been\r\nserved by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\"",
    "\"A very remarkable account,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"A fitting #NN#\r\nto an extremely interesting case.  There is nothing at all new to me in\r\nthe latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own\r\nrope.  That I did not know.  By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had\r\nlost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\"",
    "\"He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe\r\nat the time.\"",
    "\"Ah, of course,\" said Holmes.  \"I had not thought of that.\"",
    "\"Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?\" asked the\r\nconvict, #RB#.",
    "\"I think not, thank you,\" my companion answered.",
    "\"Well, Holmes,\" said Athelney Jones, \"You are a man to be #VBN#, and\r\nwe all #NN# that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and\r\nI have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me.  I\r\nshall feel more at ease when we have our #NN# here safe under\r\nlock and key.  The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors\r\ndown-stairs.  I am much obliged to you both for your assistance.  Of\r\ncourse you will be wanted at the trial.  Good-night to you.\"",
    "\"Good-night, gentlemen both,\" said Jonathan Small.",
    "\"You first, Small,\" remarked the #JJ# Jones as they left the room.\r\n\"I'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg,\r\nwhatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman #NNP#.\"",
    "\"Well, and there is the end of our little drama,\" I remarked, after we\r\nhad set some time smoking in silence.  \"I fear that it may be the last\r\ninvestigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your\r\nmethods.  Miss Morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband\r\nin #JJ#.\"",
    "He gave a most dismal groan.  \"I feared as much,\" said he.  \"I really\r\ncannot congratulate you.\"",
    "I was a little hurt.  \"Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my\r\nchoice?\" I asked.",
    "\"Not at all.  I think she is one of the most #JJ# young ladies I\r\never met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been\r\ndoing.  She had a #VBN# genius that way: witness the way in which she\r\npreserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father.  But\r\nlove is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is #VBN# to\r\nthat true cold reason which I place above all things.  I should never\r\nmarry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\"",
    "\"I trust,\" said I, laughing, \"that my judgment may survive the ordeal.\r\nBut you look weary.\"",
    "\"Yes, the reaction is already upon me.  I shall be as limp as a rag for\r\na week.\"",
    "\"Strange,\" said I, \"how terms of what in another man I should call\r\n#NN# #JJ# with your fits of splendid energy and vigor.\"",
    "\"Yes,\" he answered, \"there are in me the #NNS# of a very fine #NN#\r\nand also of a pretty #NN# sort of fellow.  I often think of those lines\r\nof old Goethe,--",
    "  #NN# #NN# die #NN# #NN# #NN# #NN# #NNS# #NN# #NN#,\r\n  #NN# #NN# #NN# #NNP# war und zum #NN# #NNP# #NN#.",
    "\"By the way, a #NNS# of this Norwood business, you see that they had,\r\nas I #VBD#, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than\r\nLal Rao, the butler:  so Jones actually has the #JJ# honor of\r\nhaving caught one fish in his great haul.\"",
    "\"The division seems rather unfair,\" I remarked.  \"You have done all the\r\nwork in this business.  I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit,\r\npray what remains for you?\"",
    "\"For me,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"there still remains the\r\n#NN#.\"  And he stretched his long white hand up for it."],
