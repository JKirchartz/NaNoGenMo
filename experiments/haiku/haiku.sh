  # The next step is where we actually process each line and is reasonably
  # complicated.  In the "begin" part of the command we set the field separator
  # to 0xA5, this lets awk know how to separate the input.  The output record
  # separator is also set to nothing instead of the default new line character.
  # If this wasn't done a new line would be inserted after every print
  # statement.  The next part of the command prints NF followed by an
  # underscore, this is the number of fields in the input, which is the number
  # of syllables in the word.  A for loop is then run which prints each field
  # in the input. This prints the word, but removes the delimiting characters.
  # An underscore is then inserted.  Next another for loop is run which does
  # basically the same thing, except it prints and equals sign after each field
  # except the the last field.  A new line character is then printed to finish
  # off the line.
