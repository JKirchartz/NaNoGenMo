still, but as I advanced I became conscious of a low, rumbling sound, a continuous murmur, somewhere in front of me. But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit House?"  A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling. But, in the second place, why did you not come 
at once?"  Holmes glanced at his watch. I guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr. Then when he left so 
suddenly for Europe I made sure that it was so. It was evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried in this strange combination of words. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?"  Sherlock Holmes laughed.

Signor Castalotte was a bachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and both my husband and I loved him as if he were our father. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. From under this great panoply she

On the one hand, I was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. There, clinging to the stout halliards of the

Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"  "From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly.

"  A grinning red face turned once more into a pink oval, fringed with gingery fluff; the interview was at an end. I believe that he would have come all the way had it not been that Dr. At last he outs into the

It was agreed that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be edited for the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later, according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should guide us to the unknown land. Luke's. Mr. Holmes?" said he, speaking in 
well-chosen English, with a curious little mincing accent. It is the precious stone. "Why, Holmes, you

The Indian could bear this back to the world. We were residing 
at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early English charters--researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. Today, for example, its 
surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance. "  "But that is not enough, Mr. "  "Indeed, yes, Mr. "Who are you, I'd like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest, law-abiding men?"  "You're standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty," said the police captain. I suggest that we return at once to Rotherfield and then take counsel as to how we shall most profitably employ the years which lie before us. "Unloose the horses!" said Sir Nigel. 
That one dint in the short, green grass was the only material witness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight. There had been one 
contretemps; for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. I need 
not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his neighbours, and that I have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end. Nor is any occasion too small to take note of, 
for I have known such trifles as the dropping of a gauntlet, or the flicking of a breadcrumb, when well and properly followed up, lead to a most noble spear-running. It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. And now, if we

will pretend, no doubt, that I have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions. "  "But how came this?" asked Alleyne, open-eyed with astonishment. "There are 
stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is

One knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution be

The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood. With an expressive sweep of his hands one of

Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. That is just my point. Then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object.

him the document. I have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo, for some crime of violence--an event which took place in the factory of Gelder & Co. The man's skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind. Our drive pulled up at a house which

It seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter. "So much for Mr. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy. At

No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. Bird life was abundant, especially the wading

Mrs. Burston, for that was her name, was an aged widow, whose whole income depended upon a small holding of this stock. None could seem more safe and secure and at her ease than this lady, yet here also was a symbol of human life, for in an instant, even as Alleyne reined aside to let the carriage pass, a wheel flew out from among its fellows, and over it all toppled--carving, tapestry and gilt--in one wild heap, with the horses plunging, the postilion shouting, and the lady screaming from within. There were ten or a dozen

And yet I would have trusted him as I trust myself. "If your lordship will graciously permit me to open my mouth, 
I shall be happy to express my sentiments," said he, with elaborate sarcasm. "  It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not been in London all the time. "I'll choose my own time, mister. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. In reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep

He was within 
three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea of our presence. In the first place, you are probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South America--one which will be classical in the scientific history of the world?

giving back before the other's fiery rush, was upon the very brink, that a general cry warned him of his danger. Then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished through a door-way. Ma foi! you have not seen a 
drove of Nithsdale raiders on their Galloway nags, or you would not speak of loving them. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. "  The young clerk smiled at his companion's earnestness. I looked about for a 
stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see. "  He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way. All, or nearly all, had their heads 
pointed outwards, showing how the terrified men of the city had at the last moment made a vain endeavor to rejoin their families in the suburbs or the country. "Wherever there are knocks going there is Sammy in the heart of it. We were shown into the morning-room. "Your neighbor is a doctor," said he, nodding at the 
brass plate. For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. The fat, red-faced gleeman, the listening group, the archer with upraised finger beating in time to the music, and the huge sprawling figure of Hordle John, all thrown into red light and black shadow by the flickering fire in the centre--memory was to come often lovingly back to it. "His wife!" she cried. "Oh, Jack, you are in danger!"  "Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. "  "Yes. Holmes," said Hopkins, "I do not know how to express my gratitude. Lord 
John is sleeping also, his long body doubled up sideways in a basket-chair. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. "Well, well, I must not be selfish," said he, with a smile, 
as he pushed back his chair from the breakfast-table. " He glanced up at it, and then, to our amazement, he sprang from his rock, and, seizing Summerlee by the neck, he tilted his face into the air. "What do you 
think of that, Holmes?" I had read the account aloud to him, while he finished his breakfast. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor, Devine. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her. "  "And how?"  "In notes to Camberwell post office. "  "My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope. "So, gentlemen," said he, "you have attained your end and have 
certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion. I tell you, Watson, 
I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. It was 
a mighty consolation to us all to know that you were runnin' loose and had the archives in your keepin'. His eyes rolled upwards, his 
features writhed in agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. His eyes blazed at you and held you at his mercy. Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. "You should not have taken such a risk!" we 
all cried. He stooped to the fire, picked up a blazing branch, and slipped in an instant through a sallyport which he had made in our gateway. To speak plainly, the matter 
implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia. "I was already convinced, or almost 
convinced, that John Straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. 
Barrymore himself to complain. It might be thought that as a member, all the 
doings of the society would be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge. "A very commonplace little 
murder," said he. "By George!" he added. "I'll chance it," he cried. "I'll blow 
your face in if you lay a hand on me. PART I. "Nothing of the sort," said the Professor, severely. I sat 
helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. The few hours that had passed since he saw the Abbey tower stretched out in his memory until they outgrew whole months of the stagnant life of the cloister. "What object 
is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. "  "Every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it may," answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. "It might be a winding sheet," 
said Mrs. I took to adding on little sentences of my own to each question, innocent ones at first, to test whether either of our companions knew anything of the matter, and then, as I found that they showed no signs I played a more dangerous game. Following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our weight. "Brenda Tregennis," said he. "There is surely something more 
than that," said he; "some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. There is ever some cursed sheepskin in their strong boxes to prove that the rich man should be richer and the poor man poorer. As to the candle, and the blood, and the 
writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent. The evident anxiety of the man, the appearance 
of his attendant, and the joint care with which they defended their concealed possession, excited the interest of the two young Englishmen who walked within hand-touch of them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in the lawcourts? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight, same as the little companies do. Through the gateway we passed 
into the avenue, where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. "I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," 
said he, "but I have had a very serious accident during the night. "Be it so," said he. "It 
was about three, or a little after, yesterday afternoon that the world finally entered the poison belt to the extent of being completely submerged. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him. From the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom. 'Regent Street!  Regent Street!' 
sounded the voices. I rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, I followed its lights until we were clear of the town. In this great district 
the wild rubber tree flourishes, and has become, as in the Congo, a curse to the natives which can only be compared to their forced labor under the Spaniards upon the old silver mines of Darien. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round. Beneath its shade there sat a stout and elderly lady in a pink cote-hardie, leaning back among a pile of cushions, and plucking out her eyebrows with a small pair of silver tweezers. "What can I do that is good? Here I must bide, and talk and sew and spin, and spin and sew and talk. "  He beamed at us with the old paternal smile, but European science would have been somewhat amazed could they have seen their chosen child, the hope of the future, with his tangled, unkempt head, his bare chest, and his tattered clothes. "  Holmes took the glasses in his hand. "How, in the name of good-fortune, did 
you know all that, Mr. "They were on his tray this morning. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind. "  "You have saved more than us," said John, pointing to the banner which leaned against the rock behind him. We all stopped to examine that monstrous 
spoor. "  I turned it over in my mind. Where were you when you began to feel bad?"  "Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door. Of course, it is obvious that it 
is music. I don't think they would touch Challenger, but I wouldn't answer for Summerlee. It was in real 
truth our only hope. And then suddenly we perceived something which filled us with new hope. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. When I say that I started my 
pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter was complex. He proved to be a 
blackguard and deserted her. "By my hilt! mon gar. Watson, if you can spare the time, I should be very glad of your company. "  "Nay, my fair lord," quoth Aylward. For the purposes of my investigation, I 
think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery. "Come hither, 
good youth," he cried, "come hither! _Vultus ingenui puer_. But the many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands, would not let the matter rest. It reads almost as though it were an appointment. The question is, at what hour did we pass out from it?"  "The air was very bad at daybreak," said I. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. Had he done well to say so much, or had he not done better to have said more? What would the knight have said had he confessed to his love for the Lady Maude? Would he cast him off in disgrace, or might he chide him as having abused the shelter of his roof? It had been ready upon his tongue to tell him all when Sir Oliver had broken in upon them. It's 
the last that have the worst of it. He then had it returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound, as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one. "Well, there's no use my telling you 
gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny. There was also a silver cigarette-case, with "J. "  "You left your door open?"  "I locked up the papers first. To the last gasp he would always be the master. Yet it is not every question that she can answer, but only those----"  "Bertrand, Bertrand!" cried the lady in the same muttering far-away voice, "the blessed hour passes. "I say, Malone," said he, "do you remember 
that place where those beasts were?"  "Very clearly. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. A man appears from behind the curtain. Start her up, Watson, for it's time that we were on our way. You can stand right back and let me run it. I brought the paper back with me, and thought of destroying it, since I could see no way of returning it without confessing my guilt to my husband. You'll look silly, 
some o' these days, when someone comes along an' sneaks the honey. "Well, Watson," said he, "it is time 
we went down to St. "  He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the iron shutters of the window. That's clear enough, for the stains lie above each other--if you lay it over this way. " That was after the 
execution of Charles. I really had not the energy to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion, but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation. If it had not been for her coming, I should not have known where his hiding-place was. I 
know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. But it was not the sight 

of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo 

Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon 

the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it 

was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, 

there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped 

like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal 

eye has rested upon. That's why I want to get over the water as soon as you do. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed. The latter, unable to escape from the shower of blows, set spurs to his mule and rode for his life, with his enemy thundering behind him. She had some reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began to be wider and wider. "Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?"  "Obviously the business was a bad one, and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that, whatever was done, each should have an equal hand in it. Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came?  It is possible. I closed the curtain, feeling 
that my last impression was in keeping with the rest. We had plenty of money ourselves. "I took it up and examined it. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children. Paralysis of business 
and universal chaos. "Challenger!" I cried. My companion was a powerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart from the weapon, I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him. I would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. I tried again and again to make my 
Sikhs talk, but without much success. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love. "In Brixton Road, this morning," it ran, "a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the 'White Hart' Tavern and Holland Grove. I am a journalist on the Gazette. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur, but T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. "  "You mean well, Watson," said the sick man with something between a sob and a groan. It racks itself to pieces. Holmes. "  "It is my business. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends the Stapletons tonight. "Already, you see," said he. "If this is bluff upon 
your part, Mr. It is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. Is a man of my weight and substance to be thrown aside for the first three half-grown lads who have learned the trick of the tilt-yard? But hark ye, coz, I think of sending my cartel also to the prince. "  As he spoke the attendant cantered up the grassy enclosure, and pulling up his steed in front of the royal stand, blew a second fanfare upon his bugle. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. This family consisted 
of only two individuals--John Douglas and his wife. " She shuddered and buried her face in her hands. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. "  I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that I have always deferred to his wishes, even when I least understood them. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?"  "On the contrary," he answered, "it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine.

Mr. I dare say E. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot I'll take darned good care that no one else does. He looked round him in 
surprise as he emerged into the clear, starlit night. "  "He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. But how could I know--how could I know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?"  "That we should have heard his screams--my God, those screams!--and yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant. Heavily 
built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind. "I want you to take back what 
you've said, or else make it good. "LORD JOHN ROXTON:  'Is this fellow calling me a 
liar?' (Uproar. Honour is a mediaeval conception. "  "And who do you expect will answer this advertisement. "  Holmes picked up the key, and looked at it for an instant, then he handed it back. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile. "  "How did you deduce the select?"  "By the select prices. "No, sir, Dr. R. ' may have been his client. He has made it for himself. "  Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. Sometimes he was making progress 
and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. "I must explain to you, 
Mr. "  "Who are you, sir?"  "I am Cyril Overton. Holmes. " He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. "  "My dear and honored master," cried Nigel, in great anxiety, "I fear me much that in your gentleness of heart you are straining this vow which you have taken. As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Watson. "  "Glad to meet you, sir. '  "'Anything else?' he asked, smiling. "What!"  "Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand. It must have been the case, then, that the man in the waiting-room had, for some unknown reason, while I was busy with the other, ascended to the room of my resident patient. "  "'Tis the law of the 'Pied Merlin,'" shouted another. A footman opened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended. "The medical officer of health for Brighton," said he when he 
returned. I reflected as I walked that few men in the world could have spent a stranger night or added more to human knowledge in the course of it. Down 
swooped the great cog into the narrow channel which was the portal to safety. "  "Have you formed any opinion?"  "As far as I can see, the man has been driven out of his senses by fright. "   I met him accordingly next morning and we traveled down to Woking together. Six great land battles I count, with four upon sea, and seven and fifty onfalls, skirmishes and bushments. That blocks this end. You will now be 
present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor. "  "There is little merit in this confession," quoth the bailiff sternly. Now, 
thank God, I am beyond their power forever. '  "'Where have you been?' I asked, more sternly. Mortimer. "  "But Dr. "Read on, I pray you. "  "Gone, eh!" said the little girl. The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience. Now, Miss Violet, what has happened 
to you, near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey?"  The young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the following curious statement:  "My father is dead, Mr. Come along, my dear fellow, for it's an urgent call. "  Holmes smiled indulgently. "I would I had been at the side of her!"  "And so would I, since you would have been the nearer me my own. "'Of course, 
we had the drags at once, and set to work to recover the remains, but no trace of the body could we find. The lad, then, HAD a 
companion in his flight. '  "'What do you call purely nominal?'  "'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. How came the letter back in the box?"  Holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes. It could very well have fitted into his valise. " He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. "  "That would be unnecessary. "I am a connoisseur," said he, taking another 
cigarette from the box--his fourth--and lighting it from the stub of that which he had finished. Further, he had become a man of experience, was counted brave among brave men, had won the esteem and confidence of her father, and, above all, had been listened to by him when he told him the secret of his love. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement. Yet I would fain have had the feather-bed. She taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love. "Come now,

I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?"  The young inspector winced at my companion's ironical comments. "  "I would I had your eyes," said Sir Nigel, blinking at the pirate galleys. We know there has been a presentation. "That's the result of all our 
Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!"  "Never mind," I answered, "I have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. A minute later came the shaggy deer-hounds, a dozen or fourteen of them, running on a hot scent, with nose to earth and tail in air. Thus, then, friend Mac in his report:   

THE NEW WORLD 

GREAT MEETING AT THE QUEEN'S HALL 

SCENES OF UPROAR 

EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT 

WHAT WAS IT? 

NOCTURNAL RIOT IN REGENT STREET 

(Special)   "The much-discussed meeting of the Zoological Institute, convened to hear the report of the Committee of Investigation sent out last year to South America to test the assertions made by Professor Challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that Continent, was held last night in the greater Queen's Hall, and it is safe to say that it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of Science, for the proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no one present is ever likely to forget them. Behind them might still be seen the broad estuary of the Gironde, with the high towers of Saint Andre and Saint Remi shooting up from the plain. Well, after the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others. "  Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory from its pages. "John Rance," he said. "  "No. "  "Ha! Would there be any objection, Mr. "Have you your stethoscope? Might I ask you--would you have the kindness?  I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank. It was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that she had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the 
absence of all furniture. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--  The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. So long as he was 
free in London, my life would really not have been worth living. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. It is my nature. Just toss it over to me. I tell you that you will 
never beat me. "  "Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's no more to be said," she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast. I suppose they were ten miles off from me, yet even at that distance one could observe how, from time to time, they twinkled or were obscured as someone passed before them. "You will give us time," he said 
at last. Douglas, who was coming down the stairs. "  "The practice is quiet," said I, "and I have an accommodating neighbor. "  In a condensed narrative the astonished Austin was told what had happened to himself and the world. Such a yell of welcome broke forth when his black beard first protruded round the corner that I began to suspect Tarp Henry was right in his surmise, and that this assemblage was there not merely for the sake of the lecture, but because it had got rumored abroad that the famous Professor would take part in the proceedings. In a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us and was apparently absolutely happy. It was certain from the first, however, that they 
would eventually be detected, as the cook, from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window, was a man of most remarkable appearance--being a huge and hideous mulatto, with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type. "  "But why this elaborate deception?"  "Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman. This lady is a musician. He will have it all in his rag to-morrow, and sell an extra dozen among our neighbors. "  "It is simple enough as you explain it," I said, smiling. "What do you make of 
it?"  I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. "This complicates matters," 
said Gregson. "'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting 
it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. It had seemed simple enough at a distance. As we entered he made neither sound 
nor motion. "  "Now, tell me, Dr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion. But you have a long road before you. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes. His eyes looked 
malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat. "It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids. "  Holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate. "  "Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, 
looks upon as so serious. "  "There is Sir Charles's death. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim. "  "And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that. He deals with no niggard hand. "'Not at all. Au revoir, and good-morning!"  We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door. I could see him throw out his chest and stroke his beard as he looked at it. Whatever they do, they will have followers. I am so sorry about it. There is no prospect of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door. There's some of them thinks that when 'e was up among those monsters you wrote about, it was just ''Ome, Sweet 'Ome' for the master, and 'e was never in fitter company. It was the severity of Holmes's manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events. Then she 
walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah. Halfway down 

this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. It was agreed that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be edited for the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later, according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should guide us to the unknown land. It happened that my way took me past the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to look at the windows, and to see if I could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had looked out at me on the day before. When we reached it, all doubt was removed. "  "Pray proceed. "I think, Watson, we cannot do better. Holmes, to tell us that. How many men have fallen?"  "I have pricked off the tally," said Aylward, who had come aboard with his lord. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. The old driver was hanging over the splash-board like some grotesque scarecrow, his arms dangling absurdly in front of him. The long sweep of green water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamor. "It's a mongoose," I cried. Your dad says amen to every word he says.

Once or 
twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy. Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three things--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those unfortunate people. He had a motive in misleading us.

Aylward rode for half a mile with his chin upon his shoulder, looking back at a white kerchief which fluttered out of the gable window of a high house which peeped over the corner of the battlements. Adventure X. The Greek Interpreter   During my long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. She was back soon with five

"Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse. The hermit frowned at the untoward noise which broke upon his prayers, but his brow relaxed as he looked upon the broad silver piece which John held out to him.

It was more than an hour after that I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to find her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor, with his blood and brains over the room. He was more than six feet high, was in the

Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. A fringe of scouts was thrown out in front, and behind them the whole force in a solid column made their way up the long slope of the bush country until we were near the edge of the forest. "Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes. High 
and bluff the English cog; long, black and swift the pirate galleys, like two fierce lean wolves which have seen a lordly and unsuspecting stag walk past their forest lair. McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with 
evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety. On 
the one hand, I was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. Holmes brushed him aside without a word and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. It was a large apartment, with 
a long deal table in the centre, and the big stove at one side. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. From all I hear it is 
splendid pay and very little to do. How of all that, mon garcon? And how of the heap of trifles that you can see for yourselves in yonder corner? They are from the South French, every one, upon whom I have been making war. "My word, it isn't a very cheerful place," said Sir Henry. There is 
nothing to be afraid of. Put on your hat, Watson, and we will stroll down

unwelcome to Holmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which John Vincent Harden, the well known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. It was death--painless but 
inevitable--death for young and old, for weak and strong, for rich and poor, without hope or possibility of escape. "There is no object in our following them," said Holmes. "  "Yes, at the mines.

most probable that Beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Say, is not that a brave plan?"  "Nay, lady, it is a thought which is unworthy of you.

Suddenly McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. "  "Why do you not write them yourself?" I said, with some bitterness. "Not only

Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us. But why do you pluck my sleeve, Alleyne?"  "If it please you, my fair lord, there are in this corner two great tubes of iron, with many heavy balls, which may perchance be those bombards and shot of which I have heard.

kitchen door, I presume?"  "Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. "What are you going to do now, Mr. I thanked him. "  "Then stand on your guard, sir!" With a clatter and dash the two blades met once more, Alleyne pressing in so as to keep within the full sweep of the heavy blade, while Tranter as continually sprang back to have space for one of his fatal cuts. Item, that after sundry japes and jokes the 
said brother John did lift up the said Mary Sowley and did take, carry, and convey her across a stream, to the infinite relish of the devil and the exceeding detriment of his own soul, which scandalous and wilful falling away was witnessed by three members of our order. His skin was of a rich 
flower-pot red from sun and wind. The Mongolian theory I regard with deep suspicion. The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. The unfortunate 
creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Then we carried him into the other room, where he lay with a clay-colored face, puffing his purple lips in and out with every breath--a dreadful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes before. A young woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. "And I may tell you that better men than either you or I have found themselves before now prisoners in the hands of archers of England. Pardieu! I have never seen a man get off his horse as quick as did that stranger Englishman. Are you satisfied?"  "Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy. Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket. This 
explanation was borne out by 

the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing 

organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a 

verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. Captain Marvin is my name. And 
now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. See to the skin tint: it is not to be replaced, for paint as you will, it is not once in a hundred times that it is not either burned too brown in the furnace or else the color will not hold, and you get but a sickly white.

your story. "  "They discovered him a year ago," said Miss Burnet, who had sat up and was now intently following the conversation. The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn. "  "I will. For the Captal du Buch hath sworn that he will find five knights from this side of the water who will ride over any five Englishmen who ever threw leg over saddle; and Chandos hath taken up the challenge, and the prince hath promised a golden vase for the man who carries himself best, and all the court is in a buzz over it. "Look at this," 
said Baynes. "He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. About halfway up 
the forearm was a curious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin. Each pigeon-hole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such titles as "Fords," "Harbour-defences," "Aeroplanes," "Ireland," "Egypt," "Portsmouth forts," "The Channel," "Rosythe," and a score of others. "Why, dash it all, this is clear madness," cried Lord John. I got it 
from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. "Oh, you think so?"  "Don't you?"  "Well, it is quite possible, but the case is not clear to me yet.

It had been arranged, therefore, that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt. It was his suggestion that I should come round to you, and of course I at once saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident is a very singular one, though he appears to completely overrate its importance. "'See here,' said the operator after he'd

Brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties. Lord John is sleeping also, his long body doubled up sideways

what?"  "The boodle. "   "It's a fine, steemulating letter," said McArdle thoughtfully, fitting a cigarette into the long glass tube which he used as a holder. I therefore 
waited for fresh material. Suicide is out of the question. "  "What, the man who draws them?"  "Yes, I saw him at his work. The station clock marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. You will find us there, on our way to the station. The two women 
told their story clearly enough. "  "Capital!" cried the inspector. As to you, Watson, you are joining us with your old service, as I understand, so London won't be out of your way. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross. "  "And what did you do then?" asked Holmes. Meanwhile, have you anything more to 
tell us about the case?"  "Nothing, Mr. Above were three students, one on each story. She mounted a 
stair, pushed open a door, and found herself in your room. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. A strong wind blew towards us and we were 
well concealed, so there was no chance of discovery. "  "You speak of danger. "  At the sight of the man Alleyne had stood staring, but at the sound of his voice such a thrill of joy bubbled up in his heart that he had to bite his lip to keep himself from shouting outright. As evening drew in, 
the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. "  "They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand," remarked Holmes. A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished 
that morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in London. I little thought to find him among the bravest of my own chosen chieftains. A similar reward paid to any one giving information about a Greek lady whose first name is Sophy. "  "I think not. "  "You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday. Over the 
gently rising plain curved the white road which leads inland, usually flecked with travellers, but now with scarce a living form upon it, so completely had the lists drained all the district of its inhabitants. "  "Your presence will be of great service to me," he answered. There were no 
signs of the papers. I placed one arm round the trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss. Standing in the doorway and glancing round me, I had a general impression of extraordinary comfort and elegance combined with an atmosphere of masculine virility. The path of our investigation is at present obscure, but I shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up, or made a considerable advance along it. Day was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly 
making their way, singly and in groups, along the blackened path. 'There she lies, with the 
red streaks. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa. "  "I will not leave you, Sir William," returned Sir Simon Burley; "and yet, as an old soldier and one who hath seen much of war, I cannot but think that it is an ill thing for four hundred men to find themselves between an army of sixty thousand on the one side and a broad river on the other. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove. Apply 221 
B, Baker Street. " That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. He was at my very heels. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes. "Do you think you could walk round the house with me?"  "Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. He is now in his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation. It's a fine evening, and there's some open ground beyond the next block. "I've made inquiry. "  "Tut, tut! My dear sir, please do what I ask you. I had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door. The farmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact. Thick, muscular 
arms, covered with a reddish down, protruded from the wide sleeves of his habit, while his white shirt, looped up upon one side, gave a glimpse of a huge knotty leg, scarred and torn with the scratches of brambles. His footmarks had pressed 
right through the snow, so long had he stood there. "  "Then what is the theory in your mind?"  "The bicycle may have been a blind. "  Holmes grunted from the sofa. The fate of the ancestor had been typical of 
that of his descendants. "And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty 
and eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible. "I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions, Watson," said he; "I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing. "Can you 
bear pain?"  "As well as another," he answered. You can call it murder. " She raised her 
veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. It is a natural protection 
to this singular country. "  "You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now. "The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you 
only know how to use it. I had no time to think of it. You bet I was giving nothing away. However, there's no good grieving over it. It may 
be a neutral one. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. And he was devoted to his wife. An extraordinary change had come over his face. "I think I must ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are. "But if you mean to hint that it 
could reflect in any way upon this lady's honour"--his eyes blazed for an instant, and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions--"well, you are on the wrong track, that's all. Of course, it instantly occurred to me 
that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case. Holmes turned the body over 
reverently, and examined it with great attention. Again I heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman I loved. I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. "They have taken to a boat here. Just 
opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. "He made his way to 
Woking by the first train, and having examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of immense value, he had concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or two, and carrying it to the French embassy, or wherever he thought that a long price was to be had. It bore, as I should guess, some pleasure party upon their return from Brighton or from Eastbourne. When they came out through the 
French window, there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice, right in front of their noses. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone 
to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. Here am I upholding 
the good fame of the learned Duns Scotus against the foolish quibblings and poor silly reasonings of Willie Ockham. You must drop everything, Sherlock. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. ' Have you no desire, in view of later research, to modify this statement?  Do you not think that it is over-accentuated?  With your permission, I would ask the favor of an interview, as I feel strongly upon the subject, and have certain suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation. "  "I trust that you don't consider your collection closed. "  "Ah, yes. "  "If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or Russian Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?"  "I should," said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face. Not the Inquisition of 
Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. "Rocks!" they yelled, stabbing into the air with their forefingers. The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long 
sigh of relief. The stick had been removed, but there also the marks were slight. "  Alleyne smiled, but shook his head. "How can he see the guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, to mark the pathway through the mire. "To your arms, men!" roared Sir Nigel. Holmes. "  "It does give a clue. , and whom you afterwards were eager to entirely forget. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. Oh, the cunning rascal! This is how he gave me the slip the other night. Douglas must have shot 
himself. "  "I am in hopes of getting it. "  "We hoped to snare a falcon," said he presently, "but we netted a carrion-crow. Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. "  Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. Now, I'll tell you how it stands 
with me. If you will both come up and leave your boots below on the landing, I'll put you there now. Suddenly he looked at his 
watch. "When I recovered I managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper. Good-bye, and I trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you. "  "My master will not drink," said the squire. Here too dwelt those famous 
smelters and welders who had made the Bordeaux steel the most trusty upon earth, and could give a temper to lance or to sword which might mean dear life to its owner. But I'm sure I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. There is a cab coming to convey you to Norwich, Mr. "  "I beg--I implore that you will, Dr. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. "  "What for?"  "Well," the miner lowered his voice--"over the affairs. In my aching head the 
one thought was throbbing that there really was truth in this man's story, that it was of tremendous consequence, and that it would work up into inconceivable copy for the Gazette when I could obtain permission to use it. He'll be cut up 
over this, for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant. Therefore I 
am here to advise you this morning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words--abandon the case. Holmes. Very smart of you 
to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect. "  "I could not have believed it," exclaimed Alleyne. )  "Then I put you to the 
test. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto. ' Mayhap he will sing it when 
the ale has warmed him. "  "My defence?"  "Yes, sir. Holmes?"  "No, no! Darkness and Dr. Thank God! he had reached the highest of those fatal pinnacles upon which his comrade had fallen. I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh London developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year. "  "As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"  "He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. The events in question 
occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. "  "Small of faith! Small of faith!" cried the sompnour. You're not crabby, are 
you?"  "No, no, not at all. It is no time for dallying. When I had cleared it all up 
I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at 
us. "His face fell immediately. "'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very 
serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. I can't get away; for all I have in the world is in my store. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one. "  "And are you prepared to meet the cost?"  "I have no doubt, sir, that my friend Godfrey, when we find him, will be prepared to do that. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted 
her adopted father in all his undertakings. It took four strong men to get the brothers 
into the asylum carriage. "  "Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"  "No, I never heard of her using it. If there be so much as a shadow of a doubt 
as to the form of it, it were a thousand times best----"  "Peace! peace!" cried the prince impatiently. "  "But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"  "Wait a little, Mr. If my expedition had no other results it would still have been noteworthy, but a curious incident occurred to me while there which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry. "The ink-pots of

into the study. "  "We can scare hope," said Nigel, "to have all ready for our start before the feast of St. What d'you think the man died of?"  "Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over," said Holmes, dryly. Now 
she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. We jumped at 
the offer, for we were already sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be worse before it was done. It was August 2nd when we snapped our last link with the 
outer world by bidding farewell to the Esmeralda. I clutched Holmes's arm, and pointed 
upward. But what danger could threaten them here in this strong castle, under the care of famous warriors, with high walls and a broad moat around them? Who was there that could injure them? He had well-nigh persuaded himself that his fears were a foolish fancy, when his eyes fell upon that which sent the blood cold to his heart and left him gasping, with hands clutching at the counterpane. Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours. Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public. My friend was in excellent spirits over the 
success which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. "You enlarge my 
view of the possible. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight. '  "'At least,' said I, 'it gives us another mystery, and one which is even more interesting than the first. I remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus. Up above us was the lighted 
window. '  "And that recommendation, with the exaggerated estimate of my ability with which he prefaced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson, the very first thing which ever made me feel that a profession might be made out of what had up to that time been the merest hobby. "'I am sorry that I 
broke my promise, Jack,' said she; 'but if you knew all the circumstances I am sure that you would forgive me. He sprang to his feet, waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic. "  The remark had a singular effect upon his companion. Holmes and I glanced at 
each other, and Hall Pycroft took a step towards the table. " Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this 
came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. "  "The blinds are up. "Never!" said Alleyne. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be. "  "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?" said Holmes. On the other hand, we are bound to inform the police of the discovery, and to see that this poor fellow's body is looked after. Having, however, at last, 
satisfied himself as to his identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation. "  "I'd have done it to please you. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner. "He may be the better 
judge, since he hath no call to side with either of us. "The roof has fallen in!"  In vain we dragged out some of the pieces. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. His clothes, his 
watch, and even his money were in his room, but the black suit which he usually wore was missing. It had not escaped him that his opponent was breathing in short, hoarse gasps, like a man who is dizzy with fatigue. "Very good. I'm Brother Scanlan, 
Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. It's myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. There was no change in door or window this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house. A constable was standing at the kitchen door. "What! man, I am forest-born, and 
I know what comes of it. "  "I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is the man whom you suspect?"  "Oh! it is more than a suspicion. "You've hurt me!" said a childish voice 
reproachfully. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come also from Posilippo. "Then the rest I leave to your wisdom, Sir William; 
and if God sends us fortune we shall meet you again in this gorge ere it be dark. His wife and his 
children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. That's what _they_ say. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!"  The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner. For two hours we rambled about together, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately. He's a hard nail, is Jack, and a dead shot, too, but you can't leave a Grand National winner to die like that--what?"  "What do you mean to do, then?" I asked. "  Alleyne Edricson bent his head while the Abbot poured out his heartfelt supplication that Heaven would watch over this young soul, now going forth into the darkness and danger of the world. There was nothing in it to 
suggest a clue,--some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. You bar my path at your peril. We shall 
make something of you yet. "  "I am a Mackworth of Normanton," the other answered, with some uneasiness of manner. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. "It were time to check 
it," said the prince, smiling, "for Sir Nigel is too good a man for me to lose, and, by the five holy wounds! if one of those cuts came home I should have fears for our champion. His cold and proud 
nature was always averse, however, from anything in the shape of public applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no further word of himself, his methods, or his successes--a prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been removed. Both pinnacle and cliff were comparatively low--some five or six hundred feet, I should think. There had been a ring at the bell. "  "Then you may be so with me. Holmes, so long as we get our man. Holmes. I 
heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal. Yesterday, however, I learn 
that an event of extreme importance has occurred. They expect to get him every hour. Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end. At the same time, he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice. With perfect coolness Holmes 
slipped across to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into the fire. "See, they move out from the shadow. Furious and gesticulating the Gascons, white and cold and sneering the English, while the prince with a half smile glanced from one party to the other, like a man who loved to dwell upon a fiery scene, and yet dreaded least the mischief go so far that he might find it beyond his control. It was just who would get his evidence first. It was understood that Lord John 
Roxton claimed to have the skull of a phororachus. I heard no more. She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and 
laughed saucily. King had rushed in to Saunders. He had many acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he loved. I snatched it up and examined it. "Have I not noted your frequent sighs and 
vacant eye? Is she fair?"  "She is indeed," cried Alleyne from his heart, all tingling at this sudden turn of the talk. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. Finally, with a 
shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more. The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. "It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. "   Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day before. There is Lord Neville, Sir Stephen Cossington, and Sir Matthew Gourney, with Sir Walter Huet, Sir Thomas Banaster, and Sir Thomas Felton, who is the brother of the high steward. Half 
of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope. "  Dr. "We all learn by experience, and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. He had changed from the horse upon which he had ridden, and bestrode the black charger which his squire had led beside him. The behavior of the audience at present 
was good-humored, but mischievous. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Duncan Ross was. Watson there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. "Morris didn't know I could earn a living here at home. Fournaye, was seen for some hours upon Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street. "  "When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines. "By St. Paul! it seemed to me their bones were breaking through their skin. "  "I have known him for some time," said I, "but I never knew him do anything yet without a very good reason," and with that our conversation drifted off on to other topics. Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. The Elder to whose care the 
two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson 
Hope the ears of a lynx. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him. What was that?"  "A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free. "  "The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast. I tell you, Watson, 
I've only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. "  "A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?" asked Holmes. "I fancy 
that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection, which atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady's story? And now, on the top of this, comes the incident of the wineglasses. When he saw the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the fire. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?"  "Nothing could be more unlike. They all tend to deepen the impression upon my 
mind that the Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter. Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. We hurried together down the stairs and 
into the street. To my astounded senses the one seems most terrible and the other as black as night. As I dressed I 
glanced at my watch. "What is it, lady?"  "Oh, most ungallant clerk! A true knight would never have asked, but would have vowed upon the instant. "  We ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. It was with difficulty that we made our way across London Bridge. "Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I 
poured out some water from a caraffe. "  "I agree with you," said the younger statesman. "What then, Sir John?" asked 
the prince. Instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then suddenly disappeared. When I draw your attention to the strong t's of 'at' and 
'to', and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of 'quarter' and 'twelve,' you will instantly recognize the fact. It was given out that he had either thrown 
himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. I had the 
further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. "  Lestrade looked at his watch. 'You really must, you know. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. I should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months. "What's this mark?" 
he asked. At that time Mr. "  "At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. "Yes," I said, peering 
through it, "a large bird stands on the tree. In a short time he was standing close to me and listening with deep distress to the story which I told him. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. "  "It was well curved, it is true. He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers. All was quiet as in a dream landscape. Doubtless you find it so in England. We drove back to help the young lady. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise. W.

Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. There is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude. In the dim 
light I saw his head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the infamous Upwood. "'But this paragon has one fault. "  "Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know. "Is she?" he said, 
languidly. "Good dog, then!  Atheney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. "'This is a

man sat over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers. "  "You can do what you damn please about that," said Barker defiantly. It is 
horrible to me to think of him still lying there. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. You heard him yourselves to-night. "  He tut-tutted and shook his big, obstinate head. "  As he spoke, the forest pathway along which they marched opened out into a green glade, which sloped down towards the river. "  "Then it is he whom you suspect?"  "I dare not go so far as that. Holmes! What is the matter?"  My poor friend's face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man. His head was 
horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down. 
"Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own old quarters. I had a row over you with Mawson's manager. "  "Is that all?" asked Hopkins. "  "Yet it would not be to a knight's honor or good name to lower his pennon. "That tries a man's nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure. This morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me. "Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence. 
Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case. The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and 
discolourations, but undoubtedly fresh. "I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man," said Sir 
Henry; "I can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done. Then, 
again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop, which was his favourite weapon. Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. Holmes pointed 
down the long tract of road which wound, a reddish yellow band, between the brown of the heath and the budding green of the woods. He and I seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. There was a strange, loud whiz and a 
long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. "Gentlemen," he cried, "let me introduce you 
to the famous black pearl of the Borgias. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. It's cost me two hundred pound from first to last, so it isn't likely I'd give it up without gettin' my wad. But I think I have the key of the affair now. "  The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation. The nearest of 
these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown church. Holmes was standing on the door-step, 
with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe. ' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. Here are four cigar-ends that I picked out of the fireplace. "We doubt not, with the help of God, to see you 
very soon restored to those thrones from which you have been so traitorously thrust. "  "Then reparation is still within your power," said Sherlock Holmes. "And now, 
fair sir, I must hasten back to see how my rogues have fared with the brawn. We were still 
discussing it, endeavoring to adjust our minds to these new conditions, when a singular scene in the plain below arrested our attention. Having done this, he 
drew up the windows on each side, and I found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to prevent my seeing through them. I remember that during our 
short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs. Such was the general situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred. "  The freckles started out on the lady's face. "What object is served by this 
circle of misery and violence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. "  "Only as a name. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. "  "Surely, sir," said Alleyne, speaking in as persuasive and soothing a way as he could, "if your birth is gentle, there is the more reason that your manners should be gentle too. Besides, when ye talk of taking me to France, ye do not conceive how useless I should be to you, seeing that neither by training nor by nature am I fitted for the wars, and there seems to be nought but strife in those parts. "The importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. "I say yes, dog! By the three 
kings! I have seen a man gasp out his last breath for less. "  "Over the cliff with him!" shouted half a dozen voices; but ere the archers could drag him from the rocks to which he clung Sir Nigel had ridden up and called upon them to stop. "We have to go, Eliza. We are only 
just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. He swore like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death in my eyes. "There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks. It is obvious, 
therefore, that there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday. Someone 
had entered the drive. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. '  "'What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?' said I. "I 
suppose that you would know him when you saw him?" asked Holmes. Holmes," cried 
our client. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. "My dear Watson, try a little analysis 
yourself," said he, with a touch of impatience. "  "Education never ends, Watson. She must be a heartless creature to sit 
laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder. "I want you, Mr. Holmes through some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for his talents and his character. "Pray be precise as to details," said he. But I 
expect we'll have to look to London before we are through. " Holmes bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair. Lying on his face, he rested 
his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. "  "And your mother is alive?"  "Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. "  "Certainly, I will come at once. Looking back, the huge house was one blaze of 
light. The mother was at home--a little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. We will nab him as he 
climbs out," Lestrade whispered. "We shall have a coalition presently," he boomed, looking 
from his wife to me and puffing out his enormous chest. "Well, my idea was that you and I 
could rush him. It is my business to soothe it. "  "Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always asking the reason. Dr. Trevelyan," said he. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. I should have put him at about thirty, 
though he was really some years older. For I would have you give an hour or two a day whilst you are with us in discoursing with my daughter, the Lady Maude; for she is somewhat backward, I fear, and hath no love for letters, save for these poor fond romances, which do but fill her empty head with dreams of enchanted maidens and of errant cavaliers. His thin figure and long limbs struggled and fluttered like a chicken being dragged from a coop. He saw the 
question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation. Things are quiet, so friend Challenger sees 
a chance to set the public talking about him. They are endorsed outside, as you see, 'Some 
particulars of the voyage of the bark _Gloria Scott_, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th October, 1855, to her destruction in N. "I am a peaceful trader, and I am not wont to be so shouted at upon so small a matter. It IS such a 
pity! Now, you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? Only two days before the wedding, there was a paragraph in the MORNING POST to say that it was all off. "My nerves are fairly proof, Watson, but I must 
confess to a start when I saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing there on my threshhold. One moment Alleyne saw the galley's poop crowded with rushing 
figures, waving arms, exultant faces; the next it was a blood-smeared shambles, with bodies piled three deep upon each other, the living cowering behind the dead to shelter themselves from that sudden storm-blast of death. Our 
seven hundred feet of elevation give us an advantage. Three or four of the men 
round the fire were evidently underkeepers and verderers from the forest, sunburned and bearded, with the quick restless eye and lithe movements of the deer among which they lived. "Your 
last remark," said Holmes, presently, "as to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely impossible supposition. "  The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. I had, 
therefore, examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. "  "Throw down your hilt, Edricson," cried Norbury. "Well, we carried him in, 
Abdullah, Akbar, and I. "I am convinced, sir," she said, "that this matter is a 
mistake, and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. "  Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper. How Five Men held the Keep of Villefranche XXXII. For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank. Sherlock Holmes 
and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. As I approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. Why, she went up there to live in order to be near them. "  "Or that Mrs. Holmes," cried our client. "Well, in investigating this minor 
affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. In order to have my case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. "  "It must be a wild place. "  "Very good," said the Professor, indulgently; "we leave it at that. "  I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. "They tell me, 
bowmen," said he, "that ye have grown so fond of ease and plunder and high living that ye are not to be moved from this pleasant country. He darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room. On no possible supposition can we explain the evolution of such a race in this place. Thus, then, friend Mac in his report:   

THE NEW WORLD 

GREAT MEETING AT THE QUEEN'S HALL 

SCENES OF UPROAR 

EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT 

WHAT WAS IT? 

NOCTURNAL RIOT IN REGENT STREET 

(Special)   "The much-discussed meeting of the Zoological Institute, convened to hear the report of the Committee of Investigation sent out last year to South America to test the assertions made by Professor Challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that Continent, was held last night in the greater Queen's Hall, and it is safe to say that it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of Science, for the proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no one present is ever likely to forget them. "It is a noiseless lock," said he. "  "Tut, tut, we have solved some worse problems. Since it is morally 
justifiable, I have only to consider the question of personal risk. She was seated by the open window, dressed in some 
sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. Holmes gave a whistle of surprise. I looked with interest upon this 
man, who was accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of violence. You said it should not be again. It is 
from our friend Overton, and is in answer to a question from me. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever. "No doubt you think that 
you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin," he observed. You can just see if 
you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a viper's tooth emerges as you open it. There was a main 
gateway of lichen-studded stone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems, but besides this central carriage drive I observed several points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. He was in shirt 
and trousers, with no covering to his feet. "I don't know whether you think that McFarlane came out 
of jail in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself," said Lestrade. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. He turned it over. "I wonder, since 
you are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together. Is she alive?  Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned?  Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point which we still have to decide. At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes. Oh, if you do, Mr. You 
are aware, perhaps, that in this house all the servants sleep in the modern wing. He seemed to have been 
watching the clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish animation as before. The shadows of evening had fallen, and the corners of the long, low, wood-panelled room were draped in darkness. Let him, 
on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Let us have a look at that!"  The plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the wooden rails had been cracked. So much is known to the world, but what I am telling you now is what I have myself discovered. ('Shame! shame!')  He had no 
desire to be offensive. "We will go back to the note which was handed in to 
Garcia upon the evening of his death. "It would be a grand help to the police," said the 
inspector, "if these things were numbered and registered. Holmes. If only you two know of this incident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. But the note 
itself. That was this morning. "You brute, George!" she screamed. "It don't 
matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you bet. "I suppose you are aware," said he, checking off points upon his fingers, "that the cranial index is a constant factor?"  "Naturally," said I. All that I have learned I got from a friendly native in the yard of our own inn. Even the professional detectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man's story. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, 
who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. We had little time to watch them, however, for in an 
instant they had overtaken the fugitives and were making a dire slaughter among them. That's 
all. "  "Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. He got down from his window and he went off, either alone or with someone. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. It may safely be prophesied, however, that no one could have foreseen the extraordinary turn which they were actually to take. Of course they might soon 
get over the difficulty. "But the hour is late, and I must go. There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. The place which Maple White's chalk-marks had indicated as his own means of access was now entirely impassable. Alleyne was 
still seated on the rock, his griefs and his joys drifting swiftly over his mind like the shadow of clouds upon a sunlit meadow, when of a sudden he became conscious of a low, deep sound which came booming up to him through the fog. "Well shot, old lad! It is indeed over his 
head," cried the bowmen. "  "Ah! He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it. The house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs. What did you do next?  "We examined the room also. But Mr. It is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as I like. Peat-cutters on Blackdown and fishers upon the Exe heard the distant throbbing rising and falling upon the sultry summer air. But if you think I could have hurt that woman, then you don't know either me or her. "Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not----?"  "Where are your wives?" asked Young, looking round him. He had a garden and 
two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. It seems that the humans hold one side of this plateau--over yonder, where you saw the caves--and the ape-men hold this side, and there is bloody war between them all the time. He was roused, however, from his pleasant reverie by the 
sound of voices, and two people emerged from the forest some little way to his right and moved across the field in the direction of the bridge. The road by 
which Maple White had ascended was no longer available. I should have thought shame upon 
my manhood, as well as my monkhood, if I had held back my hand from her. "  A shriek of laughter came across the abyss. "  "The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. It is my experience that it is only an 
amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room. "I am 
delighted that you have come down, Mr. I don't think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. From it he drew a folded sheet of paper. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. A small boy was waiting upon the platform. Rasping up on either side, with oars trailing to save them from snapping, they poured in a living torrent with horrid yell and shrill whoop upon the defenceless merchantman. There were the broad outer and inner bailies, not paved, but sown with grass to nourish the sheep and cattle which might be driven in on sign of danger. He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?"  Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. "  We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it's there I'd leave you till we can get married. Soon the flaccid organ began to 
slowly expand and show such a tendency to upward movements that Challenger fastened the cords which held it to the trunks of the surrounding trees. "  There was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action. I was able to cover it up. "You can take two men with 
you--Manders and Reilly. When he dragged himself here one night, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what could we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. In either case, my 
dear Mr. "  "Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. You leave him in this den for three days. How Agostino Pisano Risked his Head XXII. "He has played a not unimportant part in this drama," said he. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. "Just one 
hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. At the present 
instant I am most forcibly tempted to take Professor Summerlee by that silly old beard of his and to shake his head violently backwards and forwards. It was a relief to him, therefore, when their narrow track opened out upon a larger road, and they saw some little way down it a square white house with a great bunch of holly hung out at the end of a stick from one of the upper windows. Their leader, Goodwin Hawtayne, stood upon the poop and talked with Sir Nigel, casting his eye up sometimes at the swelling sail, and then glancing back at the two seamen who held the tiller. As to the other, there was nought holy about him that I could see, and it would be cheaper for me to pray for myself than to give a crown to one who spent his days in digging for lettuces. It was about a foot square, and on the inner side there 
was a singular arrangement of lines, which I here reproduce:   They were neatly done in charcoal upon the white surface, and looked to me at first sight like some sort of rough musical score. "Let you have five 
hundred to-morrow morning. Barker. It looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and before six when the bridge was raised. "  "I will fly, Mr. It is a fair argument that wherever No. "Well, when he saw 
that they were indeed the proofs, it was then that he yielded to temptation. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I don't think any of our heads would have come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have measured less than six and a half feet. "Have I not told her all that hath befallen us?"  "You have said much, my fair lord; and yet, if I may say so, it is somewhat crowded together, so that my Lady Loring can, mayhap, scarce follow it. "No," said he, "I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife 
brought it up to me. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. The young 
novice, however, appeared to have other thoughts, for his eyes sparkled and his smile broadened. "  "It is a long road yet to Brockenhurst," said Alleyne; "but here is such bread and cheese as I have left, and here, too, is a penny which may help you to supper. "She is very fast," he said. "Everything depends upon our speed. "  "I assure you that I am in your hands. If ever a man was three parts mad with terror, that man's name is Pinner. "  "You can tell us, Godfrey," said Du Guesclin to the French squire: "how came these men into the castle, and what succors can we count upon? By St. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. I cannot bear it, I, and so my trusty Raoul goes ever before me with a cudgel to drive them from my path. So I 
thought it was time we made a break for it. "The thing, however, is, as you 
say, of the simplest. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. Holmes continued his swift investigation of documents while his prisoner cursed and swore. You've questioned her long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs. You are to ask the 
questions, Mr. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself?  The answer is obvious. "A 
well-played violin is a treat for the gods--a badly-played one----"  "Oh, that's all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "  "Over the cliff with him!" shouted half a dozen voices; but ere the archers could drag him from the rocks to which he clung Sir Nigel had ridden up and called upon them to stop. ATTENTA three times!  How often will 
he repeat it? No, that seems to be the finish. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. That accounts for 
the hammer. Knights and archers sprang to arms, convinced that some great host 
was upon them; but the guide dropped upon his knees and thanked Heaven for its mercies. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. "  "She must think of her future. "  "Yes, yes, so you are. "  "I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman. "  Three large stones formed a rough cot by the roadside, and beside it, basking in the sun, sat the hermit, with clay-colored face, dull eyes, and long withered hands. Personally I felt shy and uncomfortable at this 
obsequious adoration, and I read the same feeling in the faces of Roxton and Summerlee, but Challenger expanded like a flower in the sun. "Now, Watson, now!" cried Holmes 
with frenzied eagerness. "I think that if you knew all that I had in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in. She is a 
heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. "Well, my idea 
was that you and I could rush him. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find 
that the worst had already occurred. The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. I might, it is true, have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception. "You enlarge my view of the possible. "  "Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door. "Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Malone, I have given 
you rather more of my time than I had intended. "Well, it is quite evident that there are two 
men--more, perhaps, but at least two--who are determined for some reason to get at this fellow Blessington. "  "We should not be here if you hadn't," said I, with conviction. "  "This is insanity, Holmes. If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court-martial. He made no report of it at the time. The purchase will be completed in a week, and meanwhile you will remain in Birmingham and make yourself useful. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall. "  "But the wager?"  "I have nought to wager. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. Stapleton still looked hard at him. " With dramatic suddenness he struck a match, and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. From the Feast of the Epiphany there was mustering and massing, until, in the first week of February--three days after the White Company joined the army--the word was given for a general advance through the defile of Roncesvalles. The doctor had departed to his patients, and only the inspector and myself remained. "There are some points 
about that document, Lestrade, are there not?" said he, pushing them over. "  "Where is he, then?"  "I have already said that he must have gone to King's Pyland or to Mapleton. and Mrs. "  He went over to the door, and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical way. "Noah!  Noah!" he gasped, with a face of beetroot, while Lord 
John and I smiled in sympathy and Summerlee, like a dyspeptic goat, wagged his head in sardonic disagreement. "What's that?" cried the black-maned Bodymaster from 
the end of the table. "There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. "  "My friend Dr. "  "The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Let him go. He can save 
me--only he!"  "I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it. "  "Good, Watson, very good--but quite inadmissable. I am not hysterical, nor 
given to fainting. I do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth. I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It is your only chance. Coming down with unsigned 
warrant. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. "What is 
this, Holmes?" I cried. Every last one of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi--a copy, mind you, not the original. Holmes?" he asked. "Now 
Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. "  "Man, man," cried Sir Oliver, "your mind still runs on nought but blades and bassinets. "There are the lights of my house," he murmured, pointing to a 
glimmer among the trees. And then suddenly, with a crashing and a rending, a thudding of giant feet and a panting of monster lungs the beast was upon me once more. Do you tell me that in that 
time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark the sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man's finger, and all the rest of it? It's impossible!"  "You put it very clearly," said Holmes. If his brother would take him in, well and good. "Saddle a horse, my lad," said he. "Then you have none in me?"  "In your friendship, certainly. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. " No one ever moved in the silent woods. And yet it may seem a small matter in 
itself. Banneret or bachelor, square pennon or forked, I would not give a denier for the difference, and the less since Sir John Chandos, chosen flower of English chivalry, is himself but a humble knight. I had almost overcome my 
pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. She will not be up, so 
that we shall have a clear field. "  Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. "  "It is singular that on this particular night he should have been up. Does that suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?"  For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman's lips. Then who could this American be, and why 
should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. Holmes," the inspector answered, with a knowing grin. 
Anyhow, they had come there during the night. There had been, so far as we could follow their signs, a tunnel by which the place could be approached, the lower exit of which we had seen from below. What do you make of that, Watson?"  "Chapter the second, no doubt. There, I admit that a bicycle is impossible. You don't know this Baldwin. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. 
"Quite so!" said he, a little nettled. I mind that you said it was a splay-foot, and here's the explanation. He tore the drugget 
from the floor, and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it. He had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he was satisfied or not with the position of the case. "  "In the Italian Quarter?"  "No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. The

with you--Manders and Reilly. May God be with you!"  "May God be with you, young man!" she cried. In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez, the secretary. I give you my word that all the way, the 
father and the daughter were walking in front of us. '  "He handed me the very paper which I have here, Watson, and this is the strange catechism to which each Musgrave had to submit when he came to man's estate. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. That's all. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. The setting sun 
shone full upon the passage floor, and I could see that the old, foot-worn gray stones with which it was paved were firmly cemented together, and had certainly not been moved for many a long year. And embedded in it are these very singular enclosures. My companion let down the window, and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above it. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to do. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts. "If your Majesty would

" He cantered on as he spoke, while Alleyne, having dispensed two more pence, left the old dame standing by the furthest cottage of Hordle, with her shrill voice raised in blessings instead of revilings. Twice I have with my own ears

My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed, upon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me. If you are telegraphing

the house. "  "I hurt my leg and cannot ride," quoth the bishop's champion. This was the

The door has not been opened since last night. "  "But a blow! a blow!" cried several of the older squires. She remembered 
hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door. He had been taken swiftly to

and rang the bell. The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through. However, all this they would learn from his own lips. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has. On one side of the car a waiter with some broken glasses beside a tray was huddled near the step. "No Indian here. 
Take this note as hard as you can ride to Farnham. He has done nothing except for my sake and because I asked him. His record was magnificent. Through the plank partition he could

we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies. '  "'And a very good thing, too!' I cried. I assure you that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly. Why, it's Beppo. At six

"  "If it gets over the hedge we're done," said Summerlee, and his voice crackled into a nervous laugh as he spoke. Then, coming forth from the woods, 
they laid siege to thy castle, and for two days they girt us in and shot hard against us, with such numbers as were a marvel to see. "I am off down the river, Watson," 
said he. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning. High and bluff the English cog; long, black and swift the pirate galleys, like two fierce lean wolves which have seen a lordly and unsuspecting stag walk past their forest lair. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station. "I have perceived also that on her mantle there is

Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Summerlee rejoined, however, with a sour smile, by saying that he understood that Millbank Prison had been pulled down. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. What's this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?"  "Yes. Holmes," said the inspector, earnestly. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track. "  This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. Gilchrist, how you, an

"If you will stand there I will talk. She was altered in some subtle way. Heidegger, the German master, was missing. What's that you've got?"  "Pretty things! fine things!" cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. The latter was Colonel Ross, the 
well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service. Now, however, instead of the great white cloak, he had no clothes on at all, save a short woollen shirt and a pair of leather shoes. "How now, Sir Mayor?" he roared, in a voice 
like a bull. She put forward a hand--such a gracious, stooping attitude it was--and she pressed back my head. This is the chance of 
my lifetime in that direction. "Is that the treasure, then?" she asked, coolly enough. "There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and 
united to help me. Having thus, amid a general titter, played very prettily with his interrupter, the lecturer went back to his picture of the past, the drying of the seas, the emergence of the sand-bank, the sluggish, viscous life which lay upon their margins, the overcrowded lagoons, the tendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the mud-flats, the abundance of food awaiting them, their consequent enormous growth. Him we 
enlisted at Para, on the recommendation of the steamship company, on whose vessels he had learned to speak a halting English. It is sooth that I have received seven and 
twenty wounds. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder & Co. Henry Baker," said 
Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. People did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used may be again. "  "Why, had I not met you, Aylward, at the Lynhurst inn, who can say where I had now been! Certes, I had not gone to Twynham Castle, nor become squire to Sir Nigel, nor met----" He paused abruptly and flushed to his hair, but the bowman was too busy with his own thoughts to notice his young companion's embarrassment. I proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor. "No, it is not 
selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. It was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the lady about 7:30. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise. "  "Ma foi, no!" said Sir Nigel. "  "Come," said I, laughing, "this is a little too much. Maps were drawn and

The man-eatin' Papuans had me once, but they are Chesterfields compared to this crowd. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair. Ferguson appeared to 
be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman. I've done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. Loud shrieked the brazen bugles from keep and from gateway, and merry was the rattle of the war-drum, as the men gathered in the outer bailey, with torches to light them, for the morn had not yet broken. "I've been moping in the house all day since Watson

There was a low murmur of applause. They were as nearly as possible captured red-handed. I am myself a soldier's daughter," she added, casting a somewhat languishing glance at John, "and my heart ever goes out to a brave man. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed. "  "I was thinking the same thing," said McMurdo. Therefore I shall expect to 
meet you in the smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday. When the cloth 
was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port. Peeping into the open door, they saw a sight which sent them flying, with white faces, into the village. He stood in the shadow of an oak staring at her with 
parted lips, for this woman seemed to him to be the most beautiful and graceful creature that mind could conceive of. Then, the flight grew lower and the circle narrower, until they were whizzing round and round us, the dry, rustling flap of their huge slate-colored wings filling the air with a volume of sound that made me think of Hendon aerodrome upon a race day. "They've got her, that hell-hound Woodley 
and the blackguard parson. "I have not heard a man speak better since old Dom Bertrand died, who was at one time chaplain to the White Company. Solemnity and humility are at the base of all

Finally, finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with a blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found us bending over him. Those empty lives 
which were wasted in aimless visiting and being visited, in the worry of great and unnecessary households, in the arranging and eating of elaborate and tedious meals, have now found rest and health in the reading, the music, the gentle family communion which comes from a simpler and saner division of their time. Has it seemed to thee, Alleyne, that she loves any one?"  "Nay, I cannot say," said Alleyne, with a wild throb of sudden hope in his heart. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones. But if he gained favour with his fellows, there was 
another quarter, one which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. We know now 
why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. "Now, how 
did you know that I was going to propose?" I asked in genuine wonder. Put your ears down to my mouth. 
With the policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. "  "I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Granting the

"  "Your net and box would have told me as much," said I, "for I knew that Mr. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. "  "Anything else?" I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand, and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way. There, in front of their 
respective pavilions, flew the martlets of Audley, the roses of Loring, the scarlet bars of Wake, the lion of the Percies and the silver wings of the Beauchamps, each supported by a squire clad in hanging green stuff to represent so many Tritons, and bearing a huge conch-shell in their left hands. There were two guides given us to start with, an oak and an elm. Banneret or bachelor, square pennon

appearance was glorious. "Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!" The wooden 
lid was replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade's voice was heard in the passage. "  He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical pair of eyes, taking note of the effect which this document would produce. We humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. My submission pleased him and led him to further confidences. For myself, I used 
to stand outside the gate-way, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. "  "Who was the criminal, then?"  "The gentleman I describe. Read upon the same day at the Abbey of Beaulieu in the presence of the most reverend Abbot Berghersh and of the assembled order. Just as he finished, 
however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows. I knew that he

hours," said Holmes; "started at half-past six, and here it is back again. The old man, still clad in his surplice, burst into such a string of foul oaths as I have never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own, but, before he could raise it, he was looking down the barrel of Holmes's weapon. But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the Thames. What 
do you think we should do?"  "Let Holmes know all about it at once. "I seem to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of America. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. Of course, I could not listen to

he, and strolled back to where the voices of the contending men of science rose in a prolonged duet, the high, strident note of Summerlee rising and falling to the sonorous bass of Challenger. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, 
that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. If there had been anything worth her taking, it

bound his knees tightly to his saddle-flaps, twisted his hands in the bridle, and then, putting the gallant horse's head for the mountain path, he dashed the spurs in and fell forward fainting with his face buried in the coarse, black mane. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. "  "In security I offer----" cried Don Pedro. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It is strange that in one twelve hours the Abbey should have cast off its foulest weed and should now lose what we are fain to look upon as our choicest blossom. Such a one at Ventadour ran three courses with me betwixt daybreak and sunrise, to the great exaltation of his lady. "  "Yet our own army is a great one," said Alleyne. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. "  "And sometimes, sir knight, it is a marvel to myself. Mac. "  "That sounds more like sanity. There are many men in London, you know, who,

"  "Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. "I've come over this little matter of Colonel Barclay's death. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. It was then that I wrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. "  "Isn't it gorgeous!" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. "  As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. "I expect we all do 
our duty same as we see it; but we can't all see it the same. Englishmen in those days were skilled and prompt in such matters, for it was so not long before that Edward had embarked as many as fifty thousand men in the port of Orwell, with their horses and their baggage, all in the space of four-and-twenty hours. There are six thousand men-at-arms with ten squadrons of slingers as far as I may judge their numbers. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. "I assure you, 
Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. "  "There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to," said McMurdo, with an oath. "I don't know how it is," said he, "but I had hoped for

"I cannot explain. Before evening. "  The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by themselves, the one above the other. He was a short man of great breadth of shoulder, with vizor closed, and no blazonry upon his simple white surcoat or plain black shield. Then, right out from all the 
others and close to the edge of the cliff, were two figures, so strange, and under other circumstances so ludicrous, that they absorbed my attention. A scared man was the keeper; for, 
having chained the brute to a stake while he drank a stoup of ale at the inn, it had been baited by stray curs, until, in wrath and madness, it had plucked loose the chain, and smitten or bitten all who came in its path. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"  "I cannot say that I have. "  McMurdo laughed incredulously. "By our Lady! and withouten disrespect," quoth 
Terlake, "it is in my mind that her lady-mother is more fitted to lead a company to a storming than to have the upbringing of this tender and milk-white maid. What is this

"  "Well, well, it is no great matter for my Company, for they were all houseled and shriven ere we left Twynham Castle; and Father Christopher of the Priory gave me his word that they were as fit to march to heaven as to Gascony.

Well, after the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements. It never went better in its life. I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
