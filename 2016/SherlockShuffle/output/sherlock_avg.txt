I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means. Far away I could catch glimpses of the old gray building with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery, and I saw no more of my man. Norbury tugged thrice 
with all his strength upon the cord, and then lowered himself over the edge, while a hundred anxious faces peered over at him as he slowly clambered downwards to the end of the rope. Twice he stretched out his foot, and twice he failed to reach the point at which he aimed, but even as he swung himself for a third effort a stone from a sling buzzed like a wasp from amid the rocks and struck him full upon the side of his head. It is incredible, impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. He was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him, and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, 
or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. "  I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. "  "Stolen, then. "You gave me such a fright. "  "By all means. "  "Yes," he answered, "there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. There was little Robby Withstaff, 
and Andrew Salblaster, and Wat Alspaye, who broke the neck of the German. It is death. In 
an instant the Lady Maude had turned upon her two blazing eyes and a face which was blanched with anger. We saw it whisk past the light 
thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house. 
"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. He stamped his feet upon the ground. His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way 
by which the baronet could be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer. I fancy she knows more about this than appears. My 
senses swam, but I still tore at the hand and forced it out from my chin. He was 
still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. "He looks like a beaten 
man," cried Phelps. "Oh, he rates my assistance too highly," said Sherlock 
Holmes, lightly. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. Peter Karsdale, who was but a common country lout newly brought over, with the English fleas still hopping under his doublet, laid his great hands upon the Sieur Amaury de Chatonville, who owns half Picardy, and had five thousand crowns out of him, with his horse and harness. This day, however, he had been 
sombre and mute, with scarce a word a mile to bestow upon his comrade. On the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. They were close upon it when of a sudden there broke out a wild hubbub from a distant portion of the camp, with screams and war-cries and all the wild tumult of battle. My 
companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. I sit and muse and make an 
occasional note. Of the woman nothing was ever heard, and the probability is that she got away out of England and carried herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the seas. "  "Texas, I think. "  "Impossible, I say. L. "  "How do you know this, Barrymore?"  "Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. Are you going to bed, Holmes?"  "No:  I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. However, we must do what we can. He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it. "I have been a governess for five years," said she, 
"in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. Think better of it, dear! Trust me again, and you will never have cause to regret it. "  She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down the whole level of the interview. I should think he may have had some secret trouble. "Susan is a country girl," said he, "and you 
know the incredible stupidity of that class. I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words, and that she twisted them into this meaningless message. '  "I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified at this unexpected news. Melas, I 
hope, but we could not get on without you. It was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which 
did but confirm our own deductions. He hath fled the law and is beyond its pale. What 
did he do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket--you will see the impression in the dust--and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. "  "I am convinced myself," said I, "that there is an understanding between those two people. Poor lady, she has had a most dreadful experience. It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London--a disease, too, of which I had made such a very special study. There were one or two folk who were inclined to take him seriously, but he soon choked them off. "  I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. "  "This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument. "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a 
good many cases, Mr. "  (This curious phrase he pronounced as if it were all one word--"young-fellah-me-lad. "  "I did not say that I had read all the letter. Besides the chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary, Harraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin, Carter, the treasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing. It is an inconceivable thing, but even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of the Times, has not roused these people from their slumbers. This leads 
to his murder by someone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside. I opened 
his despatch-box, took the paper, and conveyed it to Godolphin Street. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. 
Instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe, locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. Scarce had the last deep "amen" broken from the Company, when, in an instant, there rose the scream of a hundred bugles, with the deep rolling of drums and the clashing of cymbals, all sounding together in one deafening uproar. 
Knights and archers sprang to arms, convinced that some great host was upon them; but the guide dropped upon his knees and thanked Heaven for its mercies. "We have found them, caballeros!" he cried. "This is their 
morning call. "It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals was very dear to me. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. "   About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. "  "Exactly. Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. "  When they were gone we looked out of the window again. "You'll only get 
yourself hurt," said the inspector. "  Audley Court was not an attractive locality. I called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. But I have great hopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels. "  Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion's quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. "  "Then read this," quoth Sir Nigel, pointing upwards to one of the many quarterings which adorned the wall over the fireplace. "There he is stepping 
into it. "I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into our confidence. Whatever come, you always find me here. 'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire. '"  "What on earth is this?" I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady. Malone. Say 
'please,' and down you come. Let him think that Selden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. What was this paper which was stolen?"  "Madam, what you ask me is really impossible. "  "Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. Again the ground sloped, 
and again we came on the tracks. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before I could find where he was. Clambering up 
among the rocks, the companions saw a long rolling cloud of dust along the whole eastern sky-line, with the glint of spears and the flutter of pennons, which announced the approach of a large body of cavalry. For a moment a wild hope came upon them that perhaps the prince had moved more swiftly than had been planned, that he had crossed the Ebro, and that this was his vanguard sweeping to the attack. It was nearly 
five before we were back in Baker Street once more. Soon I came upon the source of it, for in the center of a small clearing I found a lake--or a pool, rather, for it was not larger than the basin of the Trafalgar Square fountain--of some black, pitch-like stuff, the surface of which rose and fell in great blisters of bursting gas. The air above it was shimmering with heat, and the ground round was so hot that I could hardly bear to lay my hand on it. He looks around him then for some tried fighting man, some honest smiter who can give a blow or take one. The others marked it and applauded. Behind stood knots of Gascon and Brabant crossbowmen from the companies of Ortingo and of La Nuit, leaning upon their unsightly weapons and watching the practice of the Englishmen. Two hundred heavily-armed 
cavalry rode behind the Audley standard, while close at their heels came the Duke of Lancaster with a glittering train, heralds tabarded with the royal arms riding three deep upon cream-colored chargers in front of him. With him came Aylward 
and Hordle John, armed as of old, but mounted for their journey upon a pair of clumsy Landes horses, heavy-headed and shambling, but of great endurance, and capable of jogging along all day, even when between the knees of the huge archer, who turned the scale at two hundred and seventy pounds. Over the edge 
there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. The enormously thick walls 
and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing, and the old one was used now as a store-house and a cellar, when it was used at all. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. "  The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time to realize it. Look at the hillside yonder. You see it marked here in the map. But you vill find other lodgings, mister. And now, boys," he continued, looking round at the company, "I'll say this much, that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for. "  There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. "A most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from 
London by Godfrey Staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening--a telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance--and yet you have not had it. MacDonald!" he kept repeating. "We'll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I'm hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails. That's one of my jobs. "  A cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. They meet, they 
write, there is a complete understanding between them. Coupled with this distortion of the 
face, this Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?"  "Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid," I answered,--"some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus. "  "That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. "That does not satisfy me in the least. "  The secretary chuckled. "  "How do you know?"  "I saw their traces. We could see the high tongues of fire shooting up into the air. "  "No, no," cried Holmes, "not a word to the cousin--not a word, I beg of you. "My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. 'It is K. If I were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures I am convinced that I should never survive it. Yours faithfully,  "TOBIAS GREGSON. "Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion 
his summons has been entirely justified," said Holmes. "I fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection, which atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. Straker was brought back here, I presume?"  "Yes; he lies upstairs. But Mr. "  "No tracks or marks?"  "None. "I have not yet described to you the most singular part. "  In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared to us. Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses. They are on the 
further side of the moat. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry. At the same instant the bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the room. I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my 
pistol, my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog. The man's sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. Even now, if we could be sure 
which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands. As to Challenger, he was wonderful!  Never have I so realized the elemental greatness of the man, the sweep and power of his understanding. "'Tell me, 
dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?'  "'Certainly not. "'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see 
for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. Stand with me here upon the 
terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have. "  He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the hedge. 
Holmes. "I am glad to stretch myself, Watson," said he. Holmes, devilish!" 
cried Mortimer Tregennis. I may tell you, however, that his Grace has already intimated that a check for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is, and another thousand to him who can name the man or men who have taken him. He 
must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named 
Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. Right in front of the house, 
upon the left-hand side of the drive, there stood a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen. OVERTON. "Strand postmark, and 
dispatched ten thirty-six," said Holmes, reading it over and over. "Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday," he said. 
He slipped into this room because it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain. "Is she?" 
he said, languidly. "I did not observe. "Ah, that's lucky," he said, and not 
another word would he utter that night. And with an apology he followed the Inspector outside. We are estranged, and I want to know why. We 
found----"  "Yes? You found----"  Holmes's face grew tense with anxiety. "  "Oh, he went out the first night, did he?"  "Yes, sir, and returned very late--after we were all in bed. As designed at 
first, no dwelling had been allotted to the lord of the castle and his family but the dark and dismal basement story of the keep. It was no easy or light 
thing to journey through this great forest, which was some twenty miles from east to west and a good sixteen from Bramshaw Woods in the north to Lymington in the south. You could easily 
recognize it, could you not?"  "Yes, sir. Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?"  "No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man. "Well, then, ask Mrs. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. Good-bye. "  When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows. "Why, there's no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already," said he. "I was on the same scent as you from the first. "On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. He was a 
charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. "'Well, my man,' said he. Might 
I ask how you know, and how much you know?' He spoke now in a half-jesting fashion, but a look of terror still lurked at the back of his eyes. "  I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. "If there be so many as has been said, then there will be much honor to be gained from them and every hope of advancement. "  And, indeed, it proved to be a very merry meal. There was no mark on any of 
them, as far as I know. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. "I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. I'd go some way to see him get 
his deserts. "  It took some doing, but I flatter myself that it wasn't such a bad job when it was finished. Not one word did she say, but as she vanished amid the trees she half turned in her saddle and waved a last greeting. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in London. "  "But why could he not tell you this?"  "Well, my dear sir, knowing the vindictive character of his old associates, he was trying to hide his own identity from everybody as long as he could. He was thoughtful and worried. "Who are you, then? What do 
you want?" he asked in a quavering voice. "  "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?"  "Exactly," said McFarlane. The flowers were trampled down, and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. Ah, there you see another blaze on the top of Crowborough Hill. "  I heard the striking of a 
match. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray "magnifiques," "coup-de-maitres," and "tours-de-force," all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman. "  Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. "I believe I 
have it!  Follow me!  Follow me!"  I hurried back along the way we had come, my torch in my hand. "When your 
round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. "  "I have a few notes for your guidance, Mr. "The third on the right is his," 
said the inspector. For three hundred years my folk have swinked and sweated, 
day in and day out, to keep the wine on the lord's table and the harness on the lord's back. There was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the others. I tried to put on as unconcerned 
an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. "A patient!" said she. "Nothing of the sort," said the 
Professor, severely. "I'll answer for that. I would have gone straight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to take your opinion first. "  "All right," said Holmes quietly. When a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job. On all sides of 
you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. One was a woman, our client, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. They consisted of 
a man and a girl, the former very tall with rounded shoulders, a limp of one foot, and a large flat object covered with dark cloth under his arm. The 
others went in. The Lady Tiphaine was lowered with a noose drawn fast under the arms, and the other five slid swiftly down, amid the cheers and joyous outcry of their rescuers. So our book has already become 
a LARGE book, which is surely something gained. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-house. The maid stood petrified for a moment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran downstairs. "I'll do so," he 
said, "we've been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. "Patent leathers [10] and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they 
got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. That is why 
I say that the murrain was the best friend that the borel folk ever had. He saw and he heard nothing, 
and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. "  "Here are paper and pen. His face was more cadaverous than ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before. From his 
spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. Lord John was an experienced mountaineer, and Summerlee had done some rough climbing at various times, so that I was really the novice at rock-work of the party; but my strength and activity may have made up for my want of experience. As for myself, I am glad 
to have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leave-taking behind me, and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing. "I am so very 
glad," said he. Don't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?"  "Not Mr. Holmes?"  "Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. "  "Mr. Suddenly we came, however, upon something which cheered our hearts. It was only when I had joined him there 
that I heard what had alarmed his quicker senses. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. "  But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his spring to the door. "  Holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar which it contained. "  "Ah!" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved. My mind 
is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built. "Is Miss Cushing at home?" asked Holmes. "  "Nay, but you will so," said one of the laborers. It is this infernal St. 
Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us--a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. "  "The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. "I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before 
leaving home but after being fully dressed. Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. At last, by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him. Presently--maybe about 
two or a little after--I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Events proved that I had judged correctly. "Having 
left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. The first message 
submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say, with some confidence, that the symbol XXX stood for E. It must, then, be 
something out of the house. "  "Life brings many a cross," said the Abbot gently. "  "What motive could your friend have in going to Lord Mount-James?"  "Well, something was worrying him the night before, and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative, who had so much of it, though from all I have heard he would not have much chance of getting it. HOW SIR NIGEL TOOK THE PATCH FROM HIS EYE. It was 
evening before the three comrades came into Aiguillon. "  "What is your theory, then?"  "Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. But 
the fact remains that there isn't. The gate of Fort Challenger had been untouched, the walls were unbroken, and yet it had been visited by some strange and powerful creature in our absence. In the middle distance lay the golf links, dotted as they had been in the morning with the dark figures of the golfers, lying motionless upon the grass of the course or among the heather which skirted it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions; though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track. Holmes, you'll hardly 
believe it, but ever since that girl has been in my employment I never once let her go past this house, where I knew the rascals were lurking, without following her on my bicycle, just to see that she came to no harm. "  "In the country, I presume, from your complexion. "  "My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. "At what time during these twenty years would not that have been a true word?" he cried. Your idea is an excellent one, Lord 
John. You slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy, in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct, the reader. I tell you that I will 
never stand in the dock. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for 
ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me. Life has 
become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track. Can 
you ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however trivial it may prove?  But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client. "  "I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. "There is nothing here," said he. "  Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand, and examined them with the utmost attention and interest. The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. He was small, 
nervous, alert with intelligent light-blue eyes and mobile features. "  "We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up. "Is he safe?" she asked. 29, Chicago?"  He bowed again. "Dark nights are unpleasant," said the voice. "Yes, for 
strangers to travel," the other answered. "  "From Charing Cross Hospital?"  "From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage. I live in a nine-hundred-diameter microscope. Then, having given him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have described. A little later a rakish young workman, with a goatee beard and a swagger, lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. "The horse was alone before," I cried. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. "That is unnecessary," said Holmes. "  The secretary chuckled.

Where is Miss Violet Smith?" he said, in his quick, clear way. "I hope that you are satisfied now?" said Mr. He was 
tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could have got to his revolver. The first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one. About sunset,

he. An impression like a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran down the centre of it. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing.

Finally we pulled the boats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the river. It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free.

Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents? Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in? And, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body, and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal? Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.

Cardboard Box   By  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle     In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents. Her face was 
turned away from him, but he could see, by the sharp intake of her breath, that she was weeping bitterly. We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young diplomatist's window. Then we distributed 
the various burdens among us--guns, ammunition, food, a tent, blankets, and the rest--and, shouldering our packages, we set forth upon the more laborious stage of our journey. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. Greaves and knee-pieces were also of leather backed by steel, and their gauntlets and shoes were of iron plates, craftily jointed.

A hansom was procured with such precaution as would prevent its being one which was placed ready for us, and I drove immediately after breakfast to the Lowther Arcade, through which I hurried at the top of my speed. After that we 
abandoned all attempt at communication. The book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it. "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr. Holmes,

But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades. We halted and listened. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity. About three o'clock

look as if she were waiting and expecting. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. In the latter, 
as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. I could tell you tales of 
cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature. In the cold, morning light it was a 
fearful sight which met my eyes. In answer to Holmes, they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor.

On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. "  "Wonderful!" said Lestrade. A three-parts-parried blow drew blood from Alleyne's left shoulder, but at the same moment he wounded Tranter slightly upon the thigh. All was silent within. I determined to say nothing

bank of the stream, we soon found that it narrowed down to a mere brook, and finally that it lost itself in a great green morass of sponge-like mosses, into which we sank up to our knees. The place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and every form of flying pest, so we were glad to find solid ground again and to make a circuit among the trees, which enabled us to outflank this pestilent morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so loud was it with insect life. This, you see, is dated from Marseilles at nine-forty-five this morning. There was no key, but it was of 
considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. "  "Then, by St. "Bide here, man. If blows be what you seek, you need not go further than Hordle. Anyhow, I can't leave here

his right walked a huge red-headed man, with broad smile and merry twinkle, whose clothes seemed to be bursting and splitting at every seam, as though he were some lusty chick who was breaking bravely from his shell. Alleyne was plodding down the slope upon one 
side, when he saw an old dame coming towards him upon the other, limping with weariness and leaning heavily upon a stick. Yet to him, used as he was to a life of such 
quiet that the failure of a brewing or the altering of an anthem had seemed to be of the deepest import, the quick changing play of the lights and shadows of life was strangely startling and interesting. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character. The peasant in the sheepskins, who had sat glum and silent all evening, had been so heated by his flagon of ale that he was talking loudly and angrily with clenched hands and flashing eyes. All was in keeping with a solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted electrical light behind him. "  With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and then came back. "By the way," he continued, coming back to his chair,

But a horrible abyss lay between it and the plateau. "'What papers? What sundial?' he asked. 
'Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last. ' I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. My data

It was strange to think that the climax of all the age-long process of Nature had been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie. What is the particular

"And the other upon the right?"  "It marks the Knights of Santiago, and I see by his flag that their grand-master rides at their head. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.

Anyhow, they had come there during the night. I'd recognized him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother wouldn't recognize him as I saw him then. I got into his room that same night,

next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. "  "Nay, trouble not for that," said Alleyne, "we are all from good mother Eve. Let him go. "  "Nay, there is but one thing that can draw the sting, and that the future may bring to me. Staunton in London?"  "Certainly not. "  "Dear me, dear me--the postoffice again!" Holmes sighed, wearily. There was no

Watson, and I'll do the same for you. "  A minute later we were both in the area. "The higher the steed the greater the fall. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the 
great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia. My first impulse was to tell Sir 
Henry all my plans. "  "I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies," said Holmes. "  Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. I had something else to think of. Someone 
had brought the water from the brook, and Lord John was sprinkling my head with it, while Challenger and Summerlee were propping me up, with concern in their faces. I expect it's that young garden 
boy, sir. My friend volunteered to go and see. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX 
NAPOLEONS   It was no very unusual thing for Mr. His increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in Baker Street. He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. The chapman broke a rough jest as he passed, and the woman called shrilly to Alleyne to come and join them, on which the man, turning suddenly from mirth to wrath, began to belabor her with his cudgel. What he will divulge I cannot tell, but I have no doubt that your Grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent. And yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in the woman's bearing--a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which compelled something of respect and admiration. Barker, I seem to be standing 
rather in the way of your explanation. He intercepted Mrs. Out we ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. It is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag, and in some cases not, but it was probable, from the way in which the flags were distributed, that they were used to break the sentence up into words. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. "Anything remarkable on hand?" he asked. "  "In the first place," said Holmes, "I should like you to offer a reward--coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. "What has he been doing?"  "Haven't you seen his letter on 'Scientific Possibeelities' in to-day's Times?"  "No. "I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there. 
This time there was loud applause. You need not stand on ceremony with us, Challenger. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. He was of a sickly color, and his thin, sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion. He 
deals with no niggard hand. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. "Really, Mr. 
Holmes," said Mr. "Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. 
We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half. "  "Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. "  It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Perhaps I have dwelt too long upon this new

If not, why should you come to consult me?"  "I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. "  When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner. Holmes thought for a little. "My dear 
Watson," said the well-remembered voice, "I owe you a thousand apologies. At eleven there was a fight at the 'White Hart'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. His brow glistened with perspiration, his cheeks were of the dull, dead white of a fish's belly, and his eyes were wild and staring. His shoes were of red leather, daintily pointed at the toes, but not yet prolonged to the extravagant lengths which the succeeding reign was to bring into fashion. At the end of that time there was a universal rising against him. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. Miss Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. "  "And how in the world did you find them?"  "It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. "These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your narrative. Come with me, and I'll fix it up as easily as possible. '   "From that day, amid all his cordiality, there was always a touch of suspicion in Mr. 'That is my own photograph,' she said.

And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he's not going to be ill, sir. "  "No, I wrote upon the day before. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. He has been upon several scientific expeditions in his youth (he was with Robertson in Papua), and the life of the camp and the canoe is nothing fresh to him. The 
silence of the deserted street reassured him. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. That the writer was on board of a ship. 
But it's the real goods, and you can lay to that. On the evening of the second 
there came a letter from Hilton Cubitt. Holmes had sat down again after one of these excursions, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud exclamation. "This will do," said he. "I must ask you, Professor 
Challenger, to cease these ignorant and unmannerly interruptions. Consider my sweet lord, that you have already won much honor, that we have seen but little of each other, that you bear upon your body the scar of over twenty wounds received in I know not how many bloody encounters. Have you not done enough for honor and the public cause?"  "My lady, when our liege lord, the king, at three score years, and my Lord Chandos at three-score and ten, are blithe and ready to lay lance in rest for England's cause, it would ill be-seem me to prate of service done. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a man with a full, black beard. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have

Ha, Sir John, I commend this worthy knight to your care. "  In a few sentences I whispered what I had done. And all the rest of your money in your left trouser pocket. What is the scientific mind to think 
of their presence?  I can only account for it by an invasion from outside. If your

For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. But the paper was uninteresting. It might happen that, should he amass riches by some happy fortune of war, this feud might hold the two families aloof. "  "God bless you, Anna!" murmured the old man again. Keep your revolver near you 
night and day, and never relax your precautions. "  "Good heavens, Holmes!  Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs with me of an instant?  It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. He passed the sign, and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned. "I will go, Mr. Grimesby 
Roylott, of Stoke Moran. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The curved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed. "  MacDonald shook his head.

I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. Let them toil and swinken, and labor, and plough the land, and take wives to themselves----"  "Alas! alas!" cried Alleyne aghast, "you have surely sucked this poison from the man Wicliffe, of whom I have heard such evil things. "  He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face. You have

My tongue is a blunt one, and fitter to shout word of command than to clear up such a matter as this, of which I can myself understand little. As for myself, I was silent,

find us; and we cannot wonder that you, who are new to tumbling, should be astounded, since many great barons, earls, marshals and knights, who have wandered as far as the Holy Land, are of one mind in saying that they have never seen a more noble or gracious performance. Holy Virgin! see the dust upon thy doublet! It were easy to see 
that there is no woman to tend to thee. So!--that is better. Now buss me, boy. The old soldiers of Crecy, of Nogent, and of Poictiers were glad to think that they might hear the war-trumpet once more, and gladder still were the hot youth who had chafed for years under the martial tales of their sires. "Dark nights are 
unpleasant," said the workman. "Yes, for strangers to travel," the other

The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. Right glad was the traveller to see the high tower of Christchurch Priory gleaming in the mellow evening light, and gladder still when, on rounding a corner, he came upon his comrades of the morning seated astraddle upon a fallen tree. Holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it. Outside the wind howled down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more. "  "Liar!" cried the woman; and, stooping her head, she suddenly bit fiercely into the broad brown hand which held her. He was a tall, handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of gray flannel, with a Panama hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked. This side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his wife. A patient, 
evidently, and possibly an all-night sitting. He was dressed from head to foot in a long white linen cloth, and a high white cap with a red cross printed upon it. The ALIBI was complete. We had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, 
and had returned about six o'clock on a cold, frosty winter's evening. Along it we 
hurried in breathless impatience for many hundreds of yards. Then, suddenly, in the black darkness of the arch in front of us we saw a gleam of dark red light. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. "  "Time it is," said Lord John. "  "Have you any reason to suspect robbery?"  "No, sir.

boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well. It is a sad thing that so small a thing as a woman should come between two who are of one blood. If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter. "  "Good God!" I cried. "  "I see. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. "It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. "  "Very curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you as being more curious still. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. But our trap should be here. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. At last,

Did no one examine?"  "Yes, I examined, myself. "It's all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is, how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?"  "Ah, that's the question," said Barker.

I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere. "  "That is a very strong prod of yours," said Johnston, shaking his grizzled head as he glanced at the thick arch and powerful strings of his rival's arbalest. "I fancy that I see your Grace's check-book upon the

side of the steps were forty or fifty barons, knights, and courtiers, ranged in a triple row to the right and the left, with a clear passage in the centre. McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there was a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad. A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his hand. "  "That won't do, my dear Watson," said Holmes, shaking his head, "for no amount of IDEE FIXE would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated. I gripped myself hard, and went on with the argument. But the vow is now nought, for, as you have never seen your company, it would be a fool's act to blame you for their doings. McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still within. The police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin--he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago--actually addressed him as he waited at the station.

"Oh, spare me, Mr. "You've come to that already, have you?"  "Oh, Ted, be reasonable--be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved me, be big-hearted and forgiving!"  "I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled," said McMurdo quietly. My word! it was a good bit of work!"  "Admirable!" cried Challenger. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. "  "Certainly.

"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League. He was born in '45--fifty years of age. He is a Russian. A subtle change had come over him. This time it was the young lady coming from the station.

"Points," he muttered; "the points. "  "What of it?  What do you mean?"  "I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this?"  "No; they are very few. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. When I came down to our room

But I must speak or I shall be too late. Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it?

It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used. He knew that I would do what I said--that his own fate was involved in mine. All this is the truth, and if I

What the scene meant

The lady stood by in haughty silence. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

address?" he asked. "BALLARAT. "  "Quite so. "I fancy that I see your Grace's check-book upon the table," said 
he. "  "That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. Her face, too, was

Then came the Germans, and they also fought very bravely, so that one or two broke through the archers and came as far as the feather-bed, but all to no purpose. Her young womanhood had, I knew,

You then--"  Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.

For all that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years' experience. Godfrey Staunton had crammed the note into his pocket. He would not go if he could help it. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are 
common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?"  "Very clearly.

He then had it returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound, as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one. He is said to have about seven

The horrible screams of the dead manager's wife pursued them as they hurried to the town. When this was drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound safe. Could you give me the date when Beppo was arrested?"  "I could tell you roughly by the pay-list," the manager answered. "No, here,"

You have known my father and my kin: is not my family one of good standing and repute?"  "Beyond all question. I have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers. He was to bring his boat round 
on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. His 
conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer. And, certes,

That's all right!  Don't wait to talk or think. It all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me. I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.

What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?"  "He says that it was a ten-pound note. " Then a sudden suspicion seized her. They left on Tuesday. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. But I take

"No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin," he observed. "  "You can take him to the mortuary now," he said. At Holmes' request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. "I heard a cab drive up," she said. "  "But what does it all mean?" I asked. It was evident that to his intensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent, and that he feared lest every fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history. "Meanwhile," said he, "I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. Your name is made, but

for his beautiful bride the future had also naught but what was good. This and a certain tinge of superstition were the

If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me. With indomitable 
patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. For a moment 
it seemed as though he would have reached it, for he had trampled over or dashed aside the archers who threw themselves in his way; but Hordle John seized him by the foot in his grasp of iron and dragged him from the saddle, while two others caught the frightened horse. I was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in June, as I sat reading the British Medical Journal after breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion's voice. Sherlock Holmes to undertake the conduct of this 
case. "I am Mr. I pray you, friend, to give us 'The Bells of Milton,' or, if you will, 'The Franklin's Maid. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's. "  "Absolutely," said Holmes. "  "Would he not have hidden a couple, had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them?"  "I suppose he would. It was a most petrifying experience. "What can it mean?" 
I gasped. "They will say that you are an infernal liar and a scientific charlatan, exactly as you and others said of me. I brought them because I had heard that you can read great things out of small ones. "I will now cut one of 
these pills in two," said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. "  "The key!" ejaculated Phelps. Simon shook his head. We got into a cab 
together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. "Make them wait 
till to-morrow, Zambo," I shouted; "then I can send letter back by them. "  "Very good, sarr! I promise they wait till to-morrow," said the negro. But it 
is bad enough that one should misuse you. Holmes?"  "Well, you put the case strongly," my friend replied thoughtfully. "  "But we have no warrant for his arrest. "These strange men are our friends. "I 
marvel that ye should have come upon none of them before, for across the water they are as common as gallybaggers. I seem to remember flopping over by the step. He sets his kingdom up to the best bidder, 
like some scullion farrier selling a glandered horse. Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry. He was again in the grip of his mysterious malady. "He is coming," he said. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. It is probable 
that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death--traces which, for some reason, must have pointed to him. I don't know 
that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement. The Inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners, but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time. Alleyne, weary with the unwonted excitements of the day, was 
soon in a deep slumber broken only by fleeting visions of twittering legs, cursing beggars, black robbers, and the many strange folk whom he had met at the "Pied Merlin. To the right Sir Oliver, Aylward, Hordle John, and the bowmen of the Company fought furiously against the monkish Knights of Santiago, who were led up the hill by their prior--a great, deep-chested man, who wore a brown monastic habit over his suit of mail. "You're surprised to see me, sir," said he, in a strange, croaking voice. "But look here, mister, I don't care for folk poking about my place without my leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better I shall be pleased. What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months' imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. It is probable that there existed an anthropoid ape in South America, who in past ages found his way to this place, and that he developed into the creatures we have seen, some of which"--here he looked hard at me--"were of an appearance and shape which, if it had been accompanied by corresponding intelligence, would, I do not hesitate to say, have reflected credit upon any living race. It may be that he needs space to breed 
some fresh bacillus less noxious than the last. "Here is Herr Heidegger, sure enough!" cried Holmes, 
exultantly. "  She was confused, but not unduly so. I can well remember that two leagues from the town of Rheims I met a very valiant and courteous cavalier of France, with whom I had gentle and most honorable contention for upwards of an hour. "It struck me that the man was small," said I. It is now close on eight o'clock. Here it is. "  

*           *           *  It was nearly six o'clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion. Indeed, he 
smoked very little, and yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends. "  "What, then, do you propose to do?" asked Summerlee, who had for once nodded his assent to the reasoning of his brother scientist. "  He drew out a 
copy from his inside pocket. "  "Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?"  "Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. "  "Did he give you no address?"  "He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually reach him. Nay, but you must not fail me, or it will go ill with me. See how his chest heaves, and his dear feathers all awry--the little knight who would not have his lady mishandled. There is goose-grease in a box, if the old scars ache at the turn of the weather. At

two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. 10. "  "That would give me time. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. He had ridden over to Poole, 
one November day, with his fellow-squire, Peter Terlake, in quest of certain yew-staves from Wat Swathling, the Dorsetshire armorer. Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy. It was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness. He remarked that we must not 
disturb the housekeeper. I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that I 
did so, for presently the man reappeared, cycling slowly back. "  We were in time to overtake the major before he reached the corner. Not here!"  "What is it here?"  "It's a murder society, that's vat it is. All right; come if you want to. With 
tingling nerves but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant. "For the sake of God, sirs," he 
whispered as he passed, "speak him fair and do not rouse him! For the love of the Virgin, be mild with him!"  "Who is this, then?" asked Sir Nigel. "  "Nay, Bertrand, I fear it as little as you," said she. "Was it your custom 
always to lock yourselves in at night?"  "Always. The thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to 
face Nature in her wildest moods. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. But the word reminds me of a small 
accomplishment, trivial but amusing, which I used to possess. "  "Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing," said the lady. I cannot explain 
the practical things of life. There was no one in the corridors, Mr. That's why I 
made a little war on my own. It would fit into any box. There was Challenger, with his smile of condescension, 
his drooping eyelids, his intolerant eyes, his aggressive beard, his huge chest, swelling and puffing as he laid down the law to Summerlee. "  "Can I be of assistance?"  "Your presence might be invaluable. "  "Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?"  "Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. "By Saint James! it is now my turn to show you where my weapon has the better of you. Christopher! 
it is indeed a fair and goodly life which you have chosen, for you gather up the spoil as a Warsash man gathers lobsters, without grace or favor from any man. "  "You are right, master-shipman," said another of the older archers. Passing 
down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Trusses of straw had been thrown down 
along the walls, and reclining on them were some twenty or thirty archers, all of the Company, their steel caps and jacks thrown off, their tunics open and their great limbs sprawling upon the clay floor. At every man's elbow stood his leathern blackjack of beer, while at the further end a hogshead with its end knocked in promised an abundant supply for the future. "Have the brethren 
come?" he asked, in the Anglo-French dialect used in religious houses. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral. Him we enlisted at 
Para, on the recommendation of the steamship company, on whose vessels he had learned to speak a halting English. It was at Para also that we engaged Gomez

when he spoke, was as deep and as fierce as the growl of a beast of prey. "  The smoking house beyond the trees had burst into flames. "I submit to any

interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me, or with more detail if possible. Allow me to introduce you to him. Whip your horse up, cabby, for we have only just time to catch our train. "  The man whom I found myself facing was a well built, fresh-complexioned young fellow, with a frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow mustache. "  "You speak of danger. Holmes--absolutely fatal. Still, there are other gangs of three besides the Randalls, or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard. It is all fair and above-board. I have said that the one person from whom we had had some sign of sympathy in our attempts to get away was the young chief whom we had rescued. I have some few references to make. As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was carrying. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. "There is nothing in which 
deduction is so necessary as in religion," said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. "It is said that Mr. Sergeant Tuson, of the City Police, was somewhat surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a 
few of my own. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. "  "Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. "Our minds will play us strange pranks, and bethink you that these words of the Lady Tiphaine Du Guesclin have wrought upon us and shaken us. "The case 
certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than I had originally thought. "Precisely. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. "  "We have been following you about all the morning. "I quite recognize that I

opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above. When the account of the railway and shipping accidents has been completed, it will furnish grim reading, although there is evidence to show that in the vast majority of cases the drivers of trains and engineers of steamers succeeded in shutting off their motive power before succumbing to the poison. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. Three servants of the castle lay dead beside them, all torn and draggled, as though a pack of wolves had been upon them. At last, after a weary week, the day had come and the hour. 
You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor. As I have already 
said, there is no man living who can fear death less than I do. They both disappeared utterly and completely. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. I braved him to do his worst. But you can imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Yet, by St. Ma foi! there were those who wished that he would have less care for their souls and a little more for their bodies!"  "It is well to have a learned clerk in every troop," said Sir Nigel. Shoot, 
mes garcons, or you will be too late. "  The throng of pirates had cleared away from the great wooden catapult, leaving two of their number to discharge it. We saw the cold winter sun rise 
over the dreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen reaches of the river, which I shall ever associate with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the earlier days of our career. What did we see first?  A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters. As it fell out, 
however, he had that very evening, ere the sun had set, a chance of seeing how stern was the grip of the English law when it did happen to seize the offender. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. The big blank spaces in the map are all being filled in, and there's no room for romance anywhere. From ten o'clock onward Mr. Such are the views which, with much passionate distortion of his thin features and wagging of his thin, goat-like beard, he poured into our ears all the way from Southampton to Manaos. Good, quiet, uncomplaining mother Nature, long slighted and miscalled, still bides her time and draws to her bosom the most errant of her children. The two 
walked swiftly across the meadow to the narrow bridge, he in front and she a pace or two behind. Right glad was the traveller to see the high tower of Christchurch Priory gleaming in the mellow evening light, and gladder still when, on rounding a corner, he came upon his comrades of the morning seated astraddle upon a fallen tree. One young knight on a gray jennet leaped over his fallen comrades and galloped swiftly up the hill, shrieking loudly upon Saint James, ere he fell within a spear-length of the English line, with the feathers of arrows thrusting out from every crevice and joint of his armor. Foully murdered, with a score of wounds upon him and a rope round his neck, his poor friend had been cast from the upper window and swung slowly in the night wind, his body rasping against the wall and his disfigured face upon a level with the casement. "My 
God!" cried Alleyne, shaking in every limb. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. He carried his head very jauntily in 
the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. With white armor, blazoned shield, and plume of ostrich-feathers from his helmet, he carried himself in so jaunty and joyous a fashion, with tossing pennon and curveting charger, that a shout of applause ran the full circle of the arena. On they rode, and on, 
until, at last, topping a ridge, they looked down upon the fateful valley. "Faith, John," said the 
prince, "it sounds as though you were right. Ha! my grace D'Armagnac, it seems 
that our friends on this side will not grieve if our English champions lose the day. When my eye is true, I am better 
at rovers than at long-butts or hoyles. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down. "You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as 
we emerged. "But my fair lady," she stammered, "what have I done? I have said no more than I heard. Wouldn't we have found the place disarranged, and missed the things which he had taken?"  "It depends on what the things were," said Holmes. "You must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own. Cerebral paresis!  Mental inertia!  Wonderful!"  He was too absurd to make me angry. Indeed, it was a waste of energy, for if you were going to be angry with this man you would be angry all the time. Here and there amid the brushwood the travellers saw the rude bundle of sticks which served them as a home--more like a fowl's nest than the dwelling-place of man. Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving 
with brain-fever. I have been followed from London Bridge Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered. M. ," I read. "Hum! He's about due. However, 
let us see what Jim Browner has to say for himself. "   Such were the singular circumstances in connection with the Resident Patient and the Brook Street Doctor. Following the path backwards, we picked out another spot, where a spring trickled across it. Beyond was an open glade, and in this were five of the most extraordinary creatures that I have ever seen. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. Between ourselves, Watson, 
it's a sporting duel between this fellow Milverton and me. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the 
steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship. Through the gloom one could dimly catch a 
glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. There were also two 
dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"  "They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door. "I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. It may have been a little over an 
hour before I reached Meiringen. "This way! This way! They are in the

But you have sent for me, Sir Nigel?"  "I would fain have your rede, Sir Oliver, for Master Hawtayne hath fears that when we veer there may come danger from the hole in our side. "  The brave little creature hurried away, and presently we heard the sizzling of a kettle. "Can you tell me his exact height?" he asked. "  "But I can. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it. Gilchrist's tan gloves 
a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message. We must be wary for a while, if we are to get the information which we want. "  "Good Lord! Good Lord! What shall I do?" cried the stranger, in an ecstasy of despair. "Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and now she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?"  "No, there ain't nothing, dearie. How can such as you speak of violence and of vengeance. I think it is safe to say that things 
can never be quite the same again. A cup of coffee would clear my brain. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. "  "Lord Holdhurst!"  "Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally destroyed. "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. "There are limits, you see, to our 
friend's intelligence. There is scope," said he. "  "A large foot or a small?"  "You could not distinguish. "Then I trust that you at least will honour me 
with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. I did so; and became at once conscious of an 
extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. I called at Allan Brothers', the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented. "  "You may safely trust us. The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. "  I have jotted down the very words of their argument, but now it degenerates into a mere noisy wrangle with much polysyllabic scientific jargon upon each side. At last she spoke in a hard and measured voice, as one who dare not trust herself to speak too freely. He took my refusal very seriously, but also very 
gently. "Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback," said he. 
Cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are. Alec Cunningham saw him from the back passage. Beyond the 
fact that he was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out. Holmes himself if you wanted fuller information. "See," said he. "No one could find his way into the 
Grimpen Mire tonight. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?" "I did not kill him," said I. I suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. The situation seemed 
beyond all words or comments. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly 
realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow. Next morning, after the office 
opened, they came to inquire. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by the Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate. She advanced along this corridor, leaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting. And yet even here we may discriminate. What is the scientific mind to think of their presence?  I can only account for it by an invasion from outside. I swear that 
another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery. I can't say for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control. '  "I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified at this unexpected news. 
ILLINGWORTH:  'Undoubtedly. I move, then, that, while Professor Summerlee be 
thanked for his interesting address, the whole matter shall be regarded as 'non-proven,' and shall be referred back to a larger, and possibly more reliable Committee of Investigation. Sherlock Holmes to undertake the conduct

found traces of the fellow's camp. This other comrade of mine is a right learned clerk, for all that he is so young, hight Alleyne, the son of Edric, brother to the Socman of Minstead. The choicest tapestries which the looms of Arras could furnish draped the walls, whereon the battles of Judas Maccabaeus were set forth, with the Jewish warriors in plate of proof, with crest and lance and banderole, as the naive artists of the day were wont to depict them. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.

With a kick and a blow he freed himself from two others who clung to him, and in a moment he was within the portal with his comrades. Both the guards who held Summerlee were down, and he was staggering about like a drunken man in his amazement, unable to realize that he was a free man. They

"How can you prove that?" he asked. "That's the worst blow yet. Where's mother?"  "Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long. It was, as I have said, a 
pit, with sharply-sloping walls and a level bottom about twenty feet across. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. Back among the groves he could see the 
high gable ends and thatched roofs of the franklins' houses, on whose fields these men found employment, or more often a thick dark column of smoke marked their position and hinted at the coarse plenty within. Yet it would be well to shoot

But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. "It was torn out of

closed the door of his oak cabinet. At the same time, Stanley Hopkins's methods do not commend themselves to me. At first he 
was very eager to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better. On the very day, however, before I left, an incident occurred which proved in the sequel to be of importance. "We were sitting out upon the lawn on garden chairs, the

We have a saying here, Sir Nigel, that if you pummel Jacques Bonhomme he will pat you, but if you pat him he will pummel you. Their method was to fall forward 
with their full weight upon each in turn, leaving him crushed and mangled, to bound on after the others. "Higher, 
Wat, higher!" "Put thy body into it, Will!" "Forget not the wind, Hal!" So ran the muttered chorus, while high above it rose the sharp twanging of the strings, the hiss of the shafts, and the short "Draw your arrow! Nick your arrow! Shoot wholly together!" from the master-bowman. And now both mangonels were at work from 
the galleys, but so covered and protected that, save at the moment of discharge, no glimpse could be caught of them. He gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts. He called on John Ferrier that night, 
and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. McMurdo had obtained a

I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man. When I got to the door----"  "You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate," my companion interrupted. "  Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. I have known such things to happen. But 
there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. When I got back 
after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men. Their height, as we approached them, seemed to me in some places to be greater than he had stated--running up in parts to at least a thousand feet--and they were curiously striated, in a manner which is, I believe, characteristic of basaltic upheavals. "  "The Worthingdon bank gang," cried the inspector. "I next called upon Madame 
Charpentier," continued the detective. When I said that you stimulated me I

Summerlee was a bit hysterical, and he laughed till he cried. At last we 
exposed that monstrous torso (fifty-four inches, by the tailor's tape). Hewers of wood and drawers of water, such were they from now onwards. We had returned across the 
plateau with our allies two days after the battle, and made our camp at the foot of their cliffs. "  "A singular case," remarked Holmes. Reuben Hayes's manner was far from

the trail of the father of all birds!"  An enormous three-toed track was imprinted in the soft mud before us. McGinty, 
you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days," the captain answered. "This man McMurdo was a crook before ever he came here, and he's a crook still. Holmes, and on 
Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor's care I should not be speaking to you now. You'll get a great welcome 
when you return. "  "I thank you," said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the dwelling house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock. Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?"  "I give it up," said Lestrade. "How do I know that they are lying? Because it

which turned me cold and sick. It gave the name John Douglas. The one to whom 
Felton found himself opposed was a tall stripling with a stag's head upon his shield, while Sir Nigel's man was broad and squat with plain steel harness, and a pink and white torse bound round his helmet. "  Alleyne lost no time in following the directions of the wild, masterless man, whom he left among the trees where he had found him. "Pardieu! yes. Now

most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days. "  Things had indeed been very slow with us, and I had learned to dread such periods of inaction, for I knew by experience that my companion's brain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous to leave it without material upon which to work. We bobbed and grinned in front of each other. Do you feel equal to it?"  "Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story. Holmes. The 
letter--for it was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. There was a 
thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. "Eminent Bodymaster," he said, in a solemn voice, "I 
claim urgency!"  "Brother McMurdo claims urgency," said McGinty. "It's a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Holmes," said he, as he sank, like a wearied man, into an armchair. "The Inspector here has done all 
that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse. "We are through, boys!  We are through!"  It was indeed the full moon which shone straight down the aperture which opened upon the cliffs. "It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. "Your telegram was dispatched about one. Holmes. "There are certainly grave difficulties in the way," said he. In the dim light I could make out that the person who had opened the door was a small, mean-looking, middle-aged man with rounded shoulders. Summerlee had lain down and slept upon the sand, but we others 
roamed round the edge of the water, seeking to learn something more of this strange country. Summerlee might be interested to know that with the Orinoco, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of country were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not impossible for one person to find what another had missed. Lord John lay 
silent, wrapped in the South American poncho which he wore, while Challenger snored with a roll and rattle which reverberated through the woods. There, prostrate upon 
their faces, lay the little red figures of the four surviving Indians, trembling with fear of us and yet imploring our protection. A huge sombre cloud, flecked with livid blotches, stretched over the whole seaward sky-line, with long ragged streamers whirled out in front of it.

The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms.

The most we can say is that the vitiated ether has produced a temporary death. Now, I make a point of never having any

stretched out to it in her longing. Her husband turned on more gas. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. My brother and I 
naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us. To think that I should have overlooked you!  I need not introduce you to Mr. That night he sat up with his

cried. "And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances?"  "I do. I have no mind as yet to show them how much they have to fear from us. "  Under his direction I cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as would ensure that it should fall as we desired. Where are we to be free from

He hoped that he would not hurt the feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that, whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life, still the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they were to end entirely in his production. All the stores of food, all the

That was our first drama at Hurlstone; but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler Brunton.

So defiling was their presence that a true Cistercian might not raise his eyes to their face or touch their finger-tips under ban of church and fear of deadly sin.

They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. "  "Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?" I asked. "Women are 
never to be entirely trusted,--not the best of them. "  I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. "  "I have no sympathy with these childish games. She was a very beautiful woman. 
When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. By the way"--his eyes darted

He ran out and ran in, smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries, devoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual questions which I put to him.

some queer illness down yonder, that's beyond all doubt, and to-day there's a cable just come in from Singapore that the lighthouses are out of action in the Straits of Sundan, and two ships on the beach in consequence. "  Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Our client, however, stared in 
amazement. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. "  "Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. The light was just fading. 
He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. "  "How did you know it, then?"  Mrs. Father, I am much beholden to this young clerk, who was of service to me and helped me this very morning in Minstead Woods, four miles to the north of the Christchurch road, where I had no call to be, you having ordered it otherwise. " All this she reeled off in a loud voice, and then glanced with sidelong, questioning eyes at Alleyne for his approval. His good-humor returned and he 
laughed. He had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn. What was that? In the 
silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. On all the French marches are 
droves of outcasts, reivers, spoilers, and draw-latches, of whom I judge that these are some, though I marvel that they should dare to come so nigh to the castle of the seneschal. From time to time an elderly man in black with rounded shoulders and a long white wand in his hand came softly forth from this inner room, and beckoned to one or other of the company, who doffed cap and followed him. Right in front of us, and almost within our 
reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. "  "I am sure that you are right, Mr. "It gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. But you will come on, will 
you not, and see Merripit House?"  A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling. "  Lord John Roxton wiped his brow. "He would follow Barrymore and see what he did. He was pale when we entered the room," said he. It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet

however, and but for the huge strength of his captor, which enabled him to disarm him with one hand, he would certainly have stabbed him. The matter has ended in reprimands, the opponents have been compelled to shake hands, and there is every hope that all will be well. In the centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. Holmes stole across and 
looked at it. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern. Twice already in his career had 
Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. Then he turned 
the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand. I could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man,

He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. His reason for attempting this special line of

Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test.

As designed at first, no dwelling had been allotted to the lord of the castle and his family but the dark and dismal basement story of the keep. I crouched low among the bushes, for I knew from past experience that with a single cry the creature could bring a hundred of its loathsome mates about my ears. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. It was easy to see by 
their dress and manner that they were two of those wandering students who formed about this time so enormous a multitude in every country in Europe. I had no idea 
how long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger's "Vie de Bohème. '  "'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement. I brought him his boots when he went for the police. "  "How on earth did you do that?"  "Look it up in the books, sir. Pardieu! I have never seen a man get off his horse as quick as did that stranger Englishman. Ere the words were past the other's lips he was beside him, his face nigh touching, and his breath hot upon his cheeks. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. Now, I make a 
point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of the investigation, I found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by Mr. Smith, when they got the boat. His health--well, I don't know that it's better nor worse for the smoking. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. "No offense, young fellah. "Seventeen from the right and 
second from the left. This is the cave sure enough. The curtain was still hanging, but the boudoir and dressing-room could be taken as one chamber for the purposes of our experiment. No figures could express them. Already you see I

evening of our perilous adventure with Challenger's home-made balloon that the change came in our fortunes. " The Professors 
nodded. "Here, then, is something to try upon," quoth the archer, pulling a square of parchment from the inside of his tunic. The tailor's tab is on the 
neck--'Neal, Outfitter, Vermissa, U. "Enough of this," said my friend, coldly. "Drop that pistol! Watson, pick it up! Hold it to his head. "Curse you!" he cried. "Who are you to interfere--you that are new to the lodge? Stand back!" He raised his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his pocket. "Not 'e. "It is 
not needful that this priest should be called, and it is in my mind that in asking for this ye cast some slight shadow or slur upon the good name of my wife, as though it were still doubtful whether her power came to her from above or below. The first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them. There was some thick, bush-like clump which seemed to be a parasite upon a branch up which I was swarming. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. "Nunc dimittis!" he cried at last. "What will 
they say in England of this?"  "My dear Summerlee, I will tell you with great confidence exactly what they will say in England," said Challenger. The brothers, who were English to a man, pricked up their ears at the sound of the homely and yet unfamiliar speech; but the Abbot flushed red with anger, and struck his hand upon the oaken arm of his chair. Right glad was the traveller to see the high tower of Christchurch Priory gleaming in the mellow evening light, and gladder still when, on rounding a corner, he came upon his comrades of the morning seated astraddle upon a fallen tree. It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. "  Mr. "I meant no harm, sir, I'm sure. I am this man's wife. "  "Well, that makes it the more effective.

Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. That was to some extent in favour of

communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville. I suppose that you will 
admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. "'Whose was it?'  "'His who is gone. '  "'Who shall have it?'  "'He who will come. '  "'Show him round here. He had, as I understand, some sort of map or chart which he was comparing with the manuscript, and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared. Then he burst into a bitter laugh. "A very commonplace little murder," said he. That is objection 
No. I don't know whether you observed it, Watson, but the Colonel's manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. I called the police 
and had the place examined. "But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. "  "It would ill beseem me to claim to be a better marksman," answered Johnston, "for I have heard great things of your skill. Soames returned and 
called for you, you were very much disturbed?"  "Yes, sir. Then out came my poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and confessed it all to me. I could name a score of 
cases in which it would have been decisive. "  "Have you her photograph?"  "I brought this with me. "  "Get a move on us and see all that has happened. "Does Lucy bear up well?" he 
asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. "Nay, not I. I had reason to think that he 
might not need them again, seeing that a thirty-inch shaft had feathered in his back. He intended to change his name altogether, draw this money, and vanish, starting life again elsewhere. For him the villain, for me the microbe. "  "You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. The 
thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. It was very long, though--almost as long, Watson, as when you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the Speckled Band. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. Nothing 
could have been more admirable than his way of putting it. It was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice, Mr. From this sure post it 
makes its sallies even to the beginning and to the end of all things. The young novice, 
however, appeared to have other thoughts, for his eyes sparkled and his smile broadened. These are the documents in the extraordinary case of the Gloria Scott, and this is the message which struck Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with horror when he read it. I hadn't much time to make it all clear to Barker and to my wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should have joined them. If, on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. Let me set down exactly what 
occurred. Now it must be evident to you, Watson, that this young man's body was PLACED on the roof of the train. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do. " His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. "What 
you say is perfectly logical, Mr. You are all turning your brains towards 
getting into this country. No powder on her nose--that proved to be the correct solution. It won't be long now before he is here to help us. ' I was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. ' Let us glance at our 
Continental Gazetteer. "   Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and I stared with astonishment at our client. "My dear Watson, when I have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation. A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit 
station, and there was a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. On the morning after our being trapped upon the plateau by the villainous Gomez we began a new stage in our experiences. They were close upon 
it when of a sudden there broke out a wild hubbub from a distant portion of the camp, with screams and war-cries and all the wild tumult of battle. "  "I fear that Watson and I must go to London. Holmes. And you, too, Dr. "  What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. Don't go, doctor. "  "It is eight o'clock now," I said, glancing at my watch. "  "And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"  "Yes. "The last words in it were 'For God's sake,'" he whispered, confidentially; "I am very anxious at getting no answer. "Precisely. "Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday. Up to 
half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so it was certainly not before that time. The first thing which I saw filled me 
with amazement. Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. The more terrible, therefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before. Pulling up his steed, he slightly inclined 
his head, and sat in the stern and composed fashion with which he had borne himself throughout, heedless of the applauding shouts and the flutter of kerchiefs from the long lines of brave men and of fair women who were looking down upon him. "Sir knight," said the prince, "we have all marvelled 
this day at this great skill and valor with which God has been pleased to endow you. The 
servants had already gone to their quarters. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner. 
This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Two of his guards caught him 
by the wrists and pulled him brutally to the front. It's a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire. "  "You do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor. "There 
was the taking of the sea-rovers, and the holding of the keep against the Jacks. "It may, of course, be trivial--individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface. I put the case before you as it has reached me. Now, Mr. Holmes, what have you to say?"  My friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating secretary. '  "Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which would help our hypothesis, and several points which would make against it. There is, 
of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. "  He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand. "  "Mrs. The pressman looked at him in mild surprise. We walked, and our way took 
us close to the office. "Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the 
bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. One day, however, when the autumn was far advanced and the vacation drawing to a close, I received a telegram from my friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe, and saying that he was in great need of my advice and assistance. This other is a milliner's account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. In order to negotiate with him they 
have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this Mr. It floods the banks, extends in great lagoons over a monstrous waste of country, and forms a huge district, called locally the Gapo, which is for the most part too marshy for foot-travel and too shallow for boating. And now, Doctor, we can do 
nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim. Hence was it that the good burghers of Romsey were all in the streets, that gay flags and flowers brightened the path from the nunnery to the church, and that a long procession wound up to the old arched door leading up the bride to these spiritual nuptials. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with 
mystery. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter missing, indispensable to-morrow. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. 'With your leave or without it, Mr. Can you hear them now?"  "Very far away. " I scribbled a note to my neighbor, rushed upstairs to explain the matter to my wife, and joined Holmes upon the door-step. "My 
name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. "  "I congratulate you. "It was a joke, my good sir--a practical joke, nothing 
more," he whined incessantly. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. --Variable. Well up in belladonna, 

opium, and poisons generally. For the last stand of the Company had been told 
throughout Christendom wherever a brave deed of arms was loved, and honors had flowed in upon the few who had survived it. "'There were three sisters altogether. '  "'You can see where it used to be?'  "'Oh, yes. "  "Indeed," said Holmes. "You are mad, Mr. You shall rue it to the end of your days. Malone got us the chart. One man can then go across and the rest will cover him with guns, until he sees that it is safe for the whole crowd to come along. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement. "He had described his household to me before I went 
there. "  "Not so. "By St. For this man was so swollen with pride that he would neither drink with us, nor sit at the same table with us, nor as much as answer a question, but must needs talk to the varlet all the time that it was well there was peace, and that he had slain more Englishmen than there were tags to his doublet. "The river washes along the front of the old 
fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. This is straight. Was it from Mr. Or did he drop 
it in the carriage?  That is also possible. The mere fact that with a comparatively small hyperoxygenation of our blood we can hold out against it is surely a proof in itself that no very great change would be needed to enable animal life to endure it. "  "I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police. The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained. At the Lymington 
River they splashed through the ford, and lay in the meadows on the further side to eat the bread and salt meat which they carried upon the sumpter horses. 
Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was animal or human. His whole bearing made me feel that something wonderful but dangerous lay before us. He spoke in 
a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune. Of course the fog was very thick. If an 
original were missing they would change the whole thing. "  "And how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. We all listened intently 
to the young man's words. '  "'Five hundred a year!' I shouted. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Yet I have been a 
good mother to him. I shall stand by him, therefore, and he shall neither be put out on the road, nor shall his ears be offended indoors. I remember the look in your eyes. Their knights and squires, lad, are every whit as good as ours, and I could pick out a score of those who ride behind Du Guesclin who would hold the lists with sharpened lances against the best men in the army of England. Large 
and small, not less than a thousand of these filthy creatures lay in the hollow before us. Behind 
there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. They paused, however, at the 
bridge, and, leaning their elbows upon the stonework, they stood looking down at their own faces in the glassy stream, and at the swift flash of speckled trout against the tawny gravel. "  "What would ye think of offering up prayer?" the man asked diffidently. "I 
will come, with pleasure," said I. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. If I backed down I knew well what 
would come to me. My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me. Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure. Our 
conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. Might I trouble you to open 
the window, for chloroform vapour does not help the palate. I could manage it better if I were alone. On the last evening he seems to have hid himself near 
the hut in which we were discussing our plans, and, being observed by our huge negro Zambo, who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all his race bear to the half-breeds, he was dragged out and carried into our presence. "Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday. "I know a dog that 
would follow that scent to the world's end. "  "That depends on how it turns out. Mac?"  "It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the same with his badge upon the forearm. Holmes, it's in better hands than mine. The 
idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. They are waiting for me at the cañon. There are no inhabitants of this land of 
despair. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. A small boy was waiting upon the platform. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen's entrance. Alleyne might talk to her of the stories of old gods and 
heroes, of gallant deeds and lofty aims, or he might hold forth upon moon and stars, and let his fancy wander over the hidden secrets of the universe, and he would have a rapt listener with flushed cheeks and eloquent eyes, who could repeat after him the very words which had fallen from his lips. Once he shook both hands furiously in the air, and twice he sprang from his seat and hurried down the road. In vain were sword-sheaths, apple-branches and belts linked together thrown out to him by his companions. "Easy, Councillor! For heaven's 
sake, go easy!" he cried, as he dragged him back. McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping for breath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked over the very edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled. "Brother 
Morris," said he, "you were always a croaker. We picked you up when you were 
starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. "  "What is your plan, then?" asked Holmes, as he walked down the dark tree-lined road. Close behind us is the moline cross of the gallant William Molyneux, and beside it the bloody chevrons of the Norfork Woodhouses, with the amulets of the Musgraves of Westmoreland. In the waist 
gathered the Southampton mariners, hairy and burly men, with their jerkins thrown off, their waists braced tight, swords, mallets, and pole-axes in their hands. Holmes stole across and 
looked at it. If only you two know of this incident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. But say nothing to 
anyone upon the matter. Sir Oliver Buttesthorn with his men-at-arms had swarmed down from the forecastle, while Sir Nigel, with his three squires, Black Simon, Aylward, Hordle John, and a score more, threw themselves from the poop and hurled themselves into the thickest of the fight. Alleyne sprang in front of the Norman, but his sword was shattered and he himself beaten to the ground by a second blow from the ponderous weapon. "The Lord Loring commands," said the boy, 
"that you will follow me to the great chamber, and await him there. " He stepped past and laid his hand 
upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred. "Do you tell me," said the sergeant, "that 
the wedding ring was BELOW the other?"  "Always!"  "Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you call the nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget ring back again. "  Dr. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little, some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Perhaps Miss Ettie 
can tell you something about it. God He knows that I am unworthy of such honor, 
yet I can show my four-and-sixty quarterings, and I have been present at some bickerings and scufflings during these twenty years. 

CHAPTER VII  

"To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown"  I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our week's stay at Para (save that I should wish to acknowledge the great kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together our equipment). But 

anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed 

which was like to be done upon the moorlands. And even as they looked the thing 

tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it 

turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the 

three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still 

screaming, across the moor. From an official point of view it's simply awful. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, 
and we were the hunters. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. "   It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. I could distinctly see the isolated, tree-crowned pinnacle of rock which was detached from the crag. Soames he went for you. 
Shall I do so? Well, well, don't trouble to answer. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. The funds of the 
society were raised by blackmailing rich Italians and threatening them with violence should they refuse the money. They had scarce reached it, however, ere they found that the wooden joists and planks of the flooring were already on fire. Mr. Douglas gave it up. No, she was not 
hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated. "John, show these gentlemen out!" A pompous butler ushered us severely to the door, and we found ourselves in the street. Holmes burst out laughing. I knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. "  "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "Anyone but a blind man could do as 
much," the other answered. She laughed at the compliment. I took her part, got 
her into a cab, and here we are. When the offer was first made, I little 
thought the turn which events might take. I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed. That 
is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. Which is it to 
be, death or life?  We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again. The Simpson incident had shown me that a 
dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. "  "How did the burglar know no one would hear it? How dared he pull at a bell-rope in that reckless fashion?"  "Exactly, Mr. He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth. I mentioned it 
to Mr. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. "'You blackguard!' I shouted, 
beside myself with rage. The purchase will be completed in a week, and meanwhile you will remain in Birmingham and make yourself useful. But at last 
he thought he saw his chance. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room. We must have something 
definite. "  "Very," said Holmes. I gripped myself hard, and went on with the argument. "  "You must remember," said Summerlee, sourly, "that I have a large class in London who are at present at the mercy of an extremely inefficient locum tenens. "  "Good heaven! Did no one examine?"  "Yes, I examined, myself. "  "And beyond that, fair son?"  "Beyond that is Jerusalem and the Holy Land, and the great river which hath its source in the Garden of Eden. Her initials were L. The first impression left by Mrs. I will explain the events 
which led up to it as shortly and as clearly as I can, though I am well aware that the fuller the detail upon such a subject the more welcome it will be to the reader, for the public curiosity has been and still is insatiable. Theirs was 
the spirit which upheld Darwin among the gauchos of the Argentine or Wallace among the head-hunters of Malaya. It is decreed by a merciful Nature that the human brain cannot think of two things simultaneously, so that if it be steeped in curiosity as to science it has no room for merely personal considerations. As to the pistol, you'll find it waiting for you, or I'm mistaken. Trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. "'What is his name?' asked my host. "'He would not give any. '  "'What does he want, then?'  "'He says that you know him, and that he only wants a moment's conversation. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. Your bones will whiten up there, and none will know where you lie or come to cover them. Why then should 
you, who are soldiers of the Spirit, be ever moping or hiding in cell or in cave, with minds full of your own concerns, while the world, which you should be mending, is going on its way, and neither sees nor hears you? Were ye all as thoughtless of your own souls as the soldier is of his body, ye would be of more avail to the souls of others. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. She is four-and-twenty. "Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing 
in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent. And what do you think they found in the pockets?"  "I cannot imagine. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety. "It is not our custom in Spain to reward pertness in 
a messenger," Don Pedro answered, patting the head of his greyhound. He read the passage aloud. "Let me have the Hotel Directory," said Holmes. "Then 
we must send them up Sir Oliver Buttesthorn," quoth Ford. Adieu, ma vie! The 
two livres shall settle the score and buy some ribbons against the next kermesse. Do not forget Sam Aylward, for his heart shall ever be thine alone--and thine, ma petite! So, marchons, and may St. Holmes. Several rolls of paper were within, covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what they referred. "Caught cold, Watson?" said he. "No, it's this poisonous 
atmosphere. "  "Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. "You see, a good many of the criminal 
classes begin to know me,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases:  so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this. "Here's the agreement on the side-table. Athelney Jones," said Holmes, quietly. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's gaiety. There is the secret of that Cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at. The next day it came out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards, on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave, and was therefore courtmartialed. Her officers were the same as in '95, with 
one exception. As she whisked round to us, I gave a cry of surprise and horror. It was a few weeks before my own 
marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. CHAPTER VIII. HOW SIR NIGEL SOUGHT FOR A WAYSIDE VENTURE. "   The night had already fallen, and the moon was shining between the rifts of ragged, drifting clouds, before Alleyne Edricson, footsore and weary from the unwonted exercise, found himself in front of the forest inn which stood upon the outskirts of Lyndhurst. "Art from Oxenford or from 
Cambridge? Hast thou a letter from the chancellor of thy college giving thee a permit to beg? Let me see thy letter. "This is indeed a day of comings and of goings. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, 
sloping at a gentle angle. We had got well out on the country road, when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred. I made for 
the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Some weeks afterwards I 
learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin. Memory, at least, will never fail me, for so long as the breath of life is in me, every hour and every action of that period will stand out as hard and clear as do the first strange happenings of our childhood. No new impressions could efface those which are so deeply cut. What could be better for the purpose? Say again, 
then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy. The various checks 
which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered. When finished, the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. He had tied his 
cord to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and he had jumped off from the top of the very box that he showed us yesterday. "He is coming," he said. "You've got us 
side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. I had smoked two cigarettes before he moved. "  "Then how is it that you did not go?"  "Because I received help in the interval from another source. "  "He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. "  "This hat has not been brushed for weeks. "  "Nay, the prince would not permit it. He retained it in his hand after using 
it to set the hound upon the track. '  "'That is true. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend. Twice ere they reached open ground they had to break their way through small bodies of horses, and once there came a whistle of arrows and singing of stones about their ears; but, still dashing onwards, they shot out from among the tents and found their own comrades retreating for the mountains at no very great distance from them. Finally we pulled the boats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the river. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form. But who could that have been, and how could he have got away?"  "That is the problem which we are now about to solve," said Sherlock Holmes. The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Then, as quick as a flash, came an expression 
of overpowering fear. You may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks, and the others--the great majority--were not. You cursed fools, you are trapped, every one of you!"  We were too astounded to speak. G. '  That is two days after Mrs. I had thought of a great office with shining tables and rows of clerks, such as I was used to, and I dare say I stared rather straight at the two deal chairs and one little table, which, with a ledger and a waste paper basket, made up the whole furniture. A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. "The newcomers were

All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. "I had gone up to town about an investment, and I 
met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. "  "And how have you succeeded?"  "Well. What copy it would have made for the Gazette!  Had ever a journalist such an opening and so little chance of using it--the scoop of scoops, and no one to appreciate it?  And then, suddenly, the old instinct of recording came over me. He thrust a hollow reed 
into it and cried out with delight like a schoolboy then he was able, on touching it with a lighted match, to cause a sharp explosion and a blue flame at the far end of the tube. "I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. On the very day that we fought over the little hussy, she went off with Evan ap Price, a long-legged Welsh dagsman. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. As I 
approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter. "You have 
implicit faith in Holmes?" he asked. Here you are, and here you will stay until 
I will otherwise. But I'll humour you. "   About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. He said that he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, 
to make some excuse if he met anyone. "  "Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek," McMurdo's neighbour informed him. "Do not go asleep; your very

would budge me until Mr. "Who--who's this?" he stammered. "It is Selden, the man who escaped from 
Princetown. I beg your pardon, sir, for I haven't spoke as much as this for many a long year, but to-day my feelings seem to 'ave got the better of me. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself. "  "Be he who he might, he was a very hardy gentleman. "The first of them was that they threw me out. "The symptoms are for some reason developing more 
rapidly upon the sea level. "Dost know who I am?"  "No, sir, I do not. "I would have you to know, clerk, that I am a free English burgher, and that I dare say my mind to our father the Pope himself, let alone such a lacquey's lacquey as you!"  "Base-born and foul-mouthed knave!" cried the sompnour. "I hear of Sherlock 
everywhere since you became his chronicler. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. "Any steps?" he asked. "  Alleyne thought of what he had read of demoniac possession--the jumpings, the twitchings, the wild talk. "  His revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt from the front of Woodley's waistcoat. "I am a practical man, Mr. "  "Then there is a lake in the center. Staunton in London?"  "Certainly not. "  "Dear me, dear me--the postoffice again!" Holmes sighed, wearily. "Lord, how 
some of that Somaliland-Uganda crowd would turn a beautiful pea-green if they saw it!  I don't know what you chaps think, but it strikes me that we are on mighty thin ice all this time. "  I had the same feeling of mystery and danger around us. "Now, I'll show you 
the explanation. "   III. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us. "  "Indeed! And anyone else?"  "There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number of public charities. "Yes, but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. "For 
years I have loved her. On the third day, however, I had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which drew her away from her husband and her duty. On the other, the

leaned forward to pick it off, when, to my horror, it burst between my finger and thumb, squirting blood in every direction. My cry of disgust had brought the two professors to my side. I 
remember that the monstrous and grotesque idea crossed my mind--the illusion may have been heightened by the heavy stuffiness of the air which we were breathing--that we were in four front seats of the stalls at the last act of the drama of the world. "  "Let me say, Mr. The Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble roof--!  The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. Just notice this point, Mr. A short walk

HOW SAMKIN AYLWARD WAGERED HIS FEATHER-BED. Black was the mouth of Twynham 
Castle, though a pair of torches burning at the further end of the gateway cast a red glare over the outer bailey, and sent a dim, ruddy flicker through the rough-hewn arch, rising and falling with fitful brightness. With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued. Any night, 
for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure. But there is nothing to 
eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. '   "The same afternoon saw us both at Hurlstone. "'We have not got our name up 
yet, for we only secured these temporary premises last week. On our way we had to pass through Hudson Street, which is a very quiet thoroughfare. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. How could I settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in Barrymore's own hands. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. It could only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning, and the rain had only begun during the night. But dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her mother's pet. "  All along the woodland track there did indeed run a scattered straggling trail of blood-marks, sometimes in single drops, and in other places in broad, ruddy gouts, smudged over the dead leaves or crimsoning the white flint stones. "He of the fur mantle has a wise and reverent face. First he must be a monk forsooth, and all because a wench was wise enough to turn her back on him. Then there came a gray friar, or minorite, with a good paunch upon him, walking slowly and looking about him with the air of a man who was at peace with himself and with all men. As a Pressman, I felt sure from what I had been told that I could never hope to get into touch with this cantankerous Professor. "Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, 
rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. Once, I remember, as we passed over the Gemmi, 
and walked along the border of the melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. Then all was blank, until he woke to find kindly blue English eyes peering down upon him and to hear the blessed sound of his country's speech. "I say, Watson," he 
whispered, "would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?"  "Not in the least," I answered in astonishment. You must keep on until you do. 
"  "Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. "Do you know," said he, "that I begin to believe that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at as well as my honor?"  "Ah!" cried Holmes. Joseph will come, too. Joseph Stangerson," said Lestrade 
gravely, "was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning. The 
details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. "  "You have found a way up?"  "I venture to think so. "  "Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den of thieves. "  "Then there is Chandos. "  "That is easily got. Sooth to say, the stout heart of Sir Nigel, which cared 
little for the wrath of her lion-like spouse, was somewhat shaken by the calm, cold face of this stately dame, for twenty years of camp-life had left him more at ease in the lists than in a lady's boudoir. He bethought him, too, as he looked at her set lips and deep-set questioning eyes, that he had heard strange tales of this same Lady Tiphaine du Guesclin. You will 
soften him, Watson. You would think that it must be forever desert. "  "Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire. "It were better for you, John 
Ferrier," he thundered, "that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!"  With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path. It may be that 
others have come into the castle. And yet there were indications that even human life itself was not far from us in those mysterious recesses. "  "Why would no one stay?" I asked. "A bicycle, certainly, but not THE bicycle," 
said he. Hungerton, her father, really was the most tactless person upon earth,--a fluffy, feathery, untidy cockatoo of a man, perfectly good-natured, but absolutely centered upon his own silly self. If anything could have driven me from Gladys, it would have been the thought of such a father-in-law. They have perished, and by my hand. You could not have made any slip in coming?"  "I did exactly what you advised. "  "Whom would you recommend, then?"  Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. "If ever geologists should by any chance

"  "Yet I would fain have your rede and counsel, Sir Simon. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will look after his chums. There is no 
prospect of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. The twitter of 
birds, the buzz of insects, the far-off echo of voices, the lowing of cattle, the distant barking of dogs, roar of trains, and rattle of carts--all these form one low, unremitting note, striking unheeded upon the ear. It was indeed a singular scene which met their 
eyes. "  "I have given up looking for either the one or the other," said Morris. By the 
way, I've got a small job for you, if you'll help me. "  "But, Aylward, think of the men whom I saw yesternight," said Alleyne. "You 
are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. "You see it?"  But I saw nothing. "I have never been a very rich man, Mr. "And you might add 
of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes," remarked my friend with a chuckle. "How long is it since there has been peace in my hapless country? Where are the steadings, and orchards, and vineyards, which made France fair? Where are the cities which made her great? From Providence to Burgundy we are beset by every prowling hireling in Christendom, who rend and tear the country which you have left too weak to guard her own marches. 
"That's the worst blow yet. As we drove up to the porticoed front door, I observed in

literary touch. These letters would have saved him. "  "You are over-grave to-day, John," the prince answered. "Wait a bit, Gregson," 
said Sherlock Holmes. "You go too fast. "  "Where is he, then? Where shall we know him?"  "Eminent Bodymaster," said McMurdo, earnestly, "I would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. "You may find 
the scath yourself, my lusty friend, if you raise your great cudgel to me. "What can you hope for? I'm fifteen stone, as hard as nails, and play center three-quarter every Saturday for the London Irish. Surely your medical experience would tell 
you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others. "  "Well, that is part of the risk. "Well, I first had the hammer examined. It 
seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica. We should soon come upon rapids, he explained, which would make its further use impossible. She is a woman of a severe and forbidding aspect, prim and demure in her bearing, very impassive in her nature, and never known within our experience to show signs of any emotion. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Foremost of all, of 
course, were the sight of the fiery caves and the certainty that some troglodytic race inhabited them. But besides that I could speak from experience of the central lake. The moon shone clear above 

them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course 

which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach 

her own home. The clerk's mind was on his brother, on his future--above all on this strange, fierce, melting, beautiful woman who had broken so suddenly into his life, and as suddenly passed out of it again. She was 
there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. I have no complaint to make. "  "Yet they have souls, fair lady, they have souls!" murmured the chaplain, a white-haired man with a weary, patient face. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. Saturday was always the lodge 
night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the order, came to see him. "     Chapter 3--Lodge 341, Vermissa    On the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter's and took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara's on the extreme outskirts of the town. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. I remember 
that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs. Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick 
and Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. "We are 
devil-ridden, Mr. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see them. "  "Any questions, Mr. "You pass too lightly over the matter. "There was nothin' 
else to be done. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them. Day by day she grew 
queerer and more irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing. I was fairly puzzled by it all. Yet, for all my care, things were not merry in the house, and I thought it well to come away. Even after I 
became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. However, once we had got out of our narrow haven of refuge into the wider atmosphere of everyday life, our normal energy came gradually back to us once more. I want 
to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. But how can one serve people who are 
so foolish and so ungrateful?"  Whilst the Seneschal of Villefranche had been detailing the evil doings of his tenants, Alleyne had been unable to take his eyes from the face of Lady Tiphaine. I have been warm under a coverlet all night, and you cold in your chairs. "By Jove!" he cried. What is this golden banner which waves upon the left?"  "It is the ensign of the Knights of Calatrava," answered Felton.

You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. "  "You have followed me wonderfully!" I exclaimed. Melas. He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels. It was 
all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute. Every time 
that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. By degrees Mr. Yet, ere the last string had twanged, he would be down on his four bones among the stricken, and have them all houseled and shriven, as quick as shelling peas. I have read Ockham, Bradwardine, and other of the schoolmen, together with the learned Duns Scotus and the book of the holy Aquinas. "  "Art so set on plunder then? Is the purse so light that there is not enough for a rouse? I have a bag at my belt, camarade, and you have but to put your fist into it for what you want. But, still, whatever your motive, 
I am glad that you went down that mine. My strength had been rather tried of late. He met me and married me there. I looked back before I reached Farnham, but the man was gone, so I thought no more about it. I have enclosed with this a rough chart of our journey, which may have the effect of making the account rather easier to understand. You'd have done 
the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place. "That girl that I 
spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. Alack and alas that ever I 
should have been fool enough to trust him! Now, young man, what manner of a bird would you suppose a pied merlin to be--that being the proper sign of my hostel?"  "Why," said Alleyne, "a merlin is a bird of the same form as an eagle or a falcon. I can well remember that learned brother Bartholomew, who is deep in all the secrets of nature, pointed one out to me as we walked together near Vinney Ridge. At first, of course, he denied everything. He was eager that I should break the entail, and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so. Yet, in spite of his shabby and even absurd appearance, his voice had a sharp crackle, and his manner a quick intensity which commanded attention. Yet the king hath given me a living here in the southlands, and please God these two lads of mine will pay off a debt that hath been owing over long. It is certain that there is a point 
where an ascent is possible. The cries of the people in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy. She 
was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention. She came to Mr. Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. I gave a trifle myself. 
It is a pure matter of form. But all I heard pointed in the one direction. Sit down on this bench, Watson, until a train for Chiselhurst arrives, and allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true. The lady's charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment. Alleyne watched him until he was small in the distance, and then, wiping the tears from his eyes, he set off briskly once more upon his journey. The youth 
had now journeyed considerably beyond the furthest domains of the Abbey. Hilton Cubitt's room, and he reported that her injuries were serious, but not necessarily fatal. She shot him and then herself--so the servants say. "  "I daresay you are right. Alleyne had turned to follow them, when he felt a 
touch upon his shoulder, and found a young page by his side. "There is no need for such 
anger," he said mildly. "I cannot expect to find it developed in all of you to the same point which it has reached in me, for I suppose that the strength of our different mental processes bears some proportion to each other. It has been a long evening, and I don't think my nerve is as good as it was. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with 
all his well-known energy and sagacity. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. "The baronet himself told him about the family 
hound, and so prepared the way for his own death. "  "That is true," said I. Your words prove that you have these, and all the rest is but the work of use and time. "  "If my hand is not hard, it is ready. "The fact is that I knew this fellow Milverton, that I considered him one of the most dangerous men in London, and that I think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. "What think you of our ways, Brother?"  McMurdo's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member. "Drums," said Lord John, 
carelessly; "war drums. I have heard them before. I staggered to the balustrades of the stair. "  "What do you mean, then?"  "I mean that I have earned the reward. "  "I could only account for it so. "  Alleyne followed the messenger to the east end of the courtyard, where a broad flight of steps led up to the doorway of the main hall, the outer wall of which is washed by the waters of the Avon. Know then that though there 
may be peace between our own provinces and the French, yet within the marches of France there is always war, for the country is much divided against itself, and is furthermore harried by bands of flayers, skinners, Brabacons, tardvenus, and the rest of them. For every statue, cut gem, shrine, carven screen, or what else might please the eye of a learned clerk, there are a good hundred to our one. "  "Your Company has been, then, to bow knee before our holy father, the Pope Urban, the prop and centre of Christendom?" asked Alleyne, much interested. Waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the platform until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger, who leaned back in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression, as if he were smiling in his sleep. There are points in it with which I disagree, and it has been my duty to indicate them as they arose, but, none the less, Mr. And it ended by my discovering traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected.

Armstrong at the door. "  "We can follow him to-morrow. "It would, perchance, be best that the novices 
be not admitted," suggested the master. It was done by a thick pen, and these are fine. Better to sleep here at this inn, and then travel on to Minstead in the morning. If his brother would take him in, well and good. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. Lower down were six reapers all in a litter, their limbs crossing, their dead, unwinking eyes gazing upwards at the glare of heaven. The blue reeks of smoke from the cottages gave 
the whole widespread landscape an air of settled order and homely comfort. "Enough of 
this," said my friend, coldly. "Drop that pistol! Watson, pick it up! Hold it to his head. Thank you. I have always had the key on my 
watch-chain. Do not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. "  "What sort of fool's talk is this? Do you back out?"  "Easy, Councillor, easy! What have I ever said or done that you should think I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of my own lodge? If it's right or if it's wrong, it's for you to decide. "  "My dear Holmes, what do you mean?"  "I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man. "  "Well, then," said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, "I suppose that you have no objection to helping me?"  Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon which he looked. There will be no difficulties for you or your baggage. When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. "  "I am ever her knight and slave. "I can see him plainly. I confess that I have 
seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem. Only a very important issue could call me from London at present. At that moment there arrived Dr. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves. They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week. "  "My Mary? Impossible!"  "It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. "With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out," he said. I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle, Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away. In the dim light 
of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. This stone is not yet twenty years old. Maple White passed Rosario four years ago, or two years before I saw his dead body. He was not alone at the time, but there was a friend, an American named James Colver, who remained in the boat and did not meet this ecclesiastic. Then, at his order, the whole tribe lay down upon the ground before us in homage. "I 
thought so," said he, "the revolver had an ejector, and here is the third cartridge. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. "  He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. If there were a hidden meaning in it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. Come along, Watson. "Ah, 
Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you?"  "No, sir, indeed I have not. It is a toss of the head and a droop of the eyes if I say one word of what is in my mind. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. Melas, that if at any time to-night you attempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is against my interests, you will find it a very serious thing. "'Yes. '  "'Well done, well done!

It was a quarter-past seven when we left Pall Mall, and my watch showed me that it was ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill. James' Street and the Strand. We 
had not long to wait for our enemy. Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder carried away the key with him when he left. But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia. It was absolutely certain, therefore,

He slipped into the first room that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. The country roads

"  "Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too," she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. The one is whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. "French land, French blood, French speech," she answered. "They are French, and France shall have them. "They can count on us

treatise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a European vogue. Hard he was of hand and harder of 
heart, hated by his foes, and yet not loved by those whom he protected, for twice he had been taken prisoner, and twice his ransom had been wrung by dint of blows and tortures out of the starving peasants and ruined farmers. George 
ramping on a discolored ground, all proclaimed as plainly as words that he was indeed from the land of war. But 
what is that upon the other galley?"  "It is the red cross of Genoa. "  "Thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop. Stapleton still looked hard at him. "  "My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery. "I came here to interview you, Professor, but it seems to 
be a case of 'Is this nigger fishing, or is this fish niggering?' You're doing most of the work. Holmes before," said Inspector MacDonald. Then he tried the various 
keys in the lock, but without success. He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to 
put on his overcoat. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite painful. I should have thought shame upon my 
manhood, as well as my monkhood, if I had held back my hand from her. There was no answer. The three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished. "That's it!" 
cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be. You have seen the cloisters; it were well that you should see the world too, ere you make choice for life between them. This sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one, but there is a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description. "  "Nay, nay, my dear Oliver," said Sir Nigel, laying his hand upon his angry friend's arm. We had during this time been following the guidance of 
Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have since led us to change our opinion. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. "  With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and then came back. His only remark was, "There's some new stuff, cuticura or something, which is better than arnica. He'll 
crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on 
his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet. Money's not everything. I'll have him out of my house before the day is done. "There has been murder done, and the 
murderer was a man. "  It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. Holmes read it and was about to 
place it in his notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He has a high opinion of you 
and thought that you were the one man in London who could help him. We were passing him when he raised his face to look at us in the circle of light thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped and screamed out in a dreadful voice, "My God, it's Nancy!" Mrs. "  "True for you," said McGinty. "You will rise high in your profession. Holmes," 
said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. "Well, I think that under the circumstances we may enter without an invitation. Holmes?" said he. When I paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below, it was pretty clear where he was. "  "Is he your junior?"  "Seven years my senior. Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony. "Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all. He may be 
dozin', and at the worst he can only wing one of us, and the other should have him. "It is not an airy nothing, you see," said he, smiling. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. One experiment served to show me the line of his investigation. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. The next instant it was gone--and so was our dinner. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA  I. There was no reason why those six should be different from any of the other casts. The boats already swarm from 
the bank. Him we enlisted at Para, on the recommendation of the steamship company, on whose vessels he had learned to speak a halting English. It was at Para also that we engaged Gomez 
and Manuel, two half-breeds from up the river, just come down with a cargo of redwood. He slipped into 
this room, because it was the first that he saw. "There is material here. I see that these candles in 
the mantelpiece have been lighted. '  "'Anything else?' he asked, smiling. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very 
happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. 'Then the worse for thy soul!' said he; and with that he broke into a long tale how that on account of the virtues of the Abbot Berghersh it had been decreed by the Pope that whoever should wear the habit of a monk of Beaulieu for as long as he might say the seven psalms of David should be assured of the kingdom of Heaven. When I heard this I prayed him on my knees that he would give me the use of his gown, which after many contentions he at last agreed to do, on my paying him three marks towards the regilding of the image of Laurence the martyr. But it did seem very loud. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. And 
now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. If such a knight as Sir Oliver Buttesthorn may turn against his own prince for the sake of a light word, then where are we to look for steadfast faith and constancy?"  "Ah! my dear little coz, it is easy to sit in the sunshine and preach to the man in the shadow. My own nervous system is an exceptionally sensitive 
one. Take my advice and be frank with me. '  "These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will read them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him. "'In a 
most extraordinary fashion. '  "'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night. ' An instant afterwards there appeared a little wizened fellow with a cringing manner and a shambling style of walking. I could understand his regarding it as of small importance when I looked at it, for the metal was almost black and the stones lustreless and dull. The ceiling 
was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. No stream could be more 
convenient for navigation, since the prevailing wind is south-east, and sailing boats may make a continuous progress to the Peruvian frontier, dropping down again with the current. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow. "  "Has he jeered at you than?"  "Pardieu! yes, 'Old Sir Oliver's heart is still stout,' said one of his court. "How far to Wallington?" he asked. "And what is it we are watching for?"  "I have no more notion than you how long it is to last," Holmes answered with some asperity. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. "  "American slang is very expressive sometimes. "  "I cannot call any to mind," answered Sir Nigel. Five hundred paces from the 
English the two great bodies of horse crossed each other, and, sweeping round in a curve, retired in feigned confusion towards their centre. "You have been cruelly used," said 
Holmes. "You are the wrong sort for such work. I have money enough and to 
spare. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. "Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new 
information. Holmes, have you solved this mystery yet?" He shoved the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion. "  Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes. According to his lights he has been a kind master. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. If it's on 
the market I'll buy it--if it means another penny on the income-tax. On the other hand, it seemed 
an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table. The land of France! Alleyne's eyes shone as he gazed upon it. Watson's umbrella, I was 
able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle. "It was of the first importance, however, that we should 
be able to prove who placed it there. "  "Except that!" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. 'Is all ready for 
Sir Henry?' That will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. "  "Ha! Where is Barrymore?"  "He is in charge of the Hall. Summerlee was shivering like a man with the 
ague, human fears, as he realized his position, rising for an instant above the stoicism of the man of science. May I ask for volunteers?"  It is thus that the great crisis of a man's life springs out at him. Could I 
have imagined when I entered that hall that I was about to pledge myself to a wilder adventure than had ever come to me in my dreams?  But Gladys--was it not the very opportunity of which she spoke?  Gladys would have told me to go. I had sprung to my feet. "  "Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"  "Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him. You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him, and all further investigation has served to strengthen it. Was I 
right?"  Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger. It is of no 
importance to us, however, since the decanters were full, and it had therefore not been used. Sometimes, for an instant, it was at fault. Then it would catch it up again and come bounding swiftly along the path I had taken. I huddled on my clothes and 
hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water. You know I like to work the detail of my cases 
out. Bhurtee was relieved by Neill next day, but the rebels took me away with them in their retreat, and it was many a long year before ever I saw a white face again. I was tortured and tried to get away, and was captured and tortured again. "  "I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Oh, she has 
turned all the men's heads down in that part. And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse. We know at least that he came so far in safety. S. ," upon the lid. "This is indeed a fine sight upon which it is good to look, and a man might go far ere he would see so many brave men and fine horses. I have pined for this, Aylward, as a young maid pines for her lover. Warren?"  "No, sir. He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in one. There are small windows on each side, which were covered by curtains and never opened. "The danger may bide," said 
he, shrugging his broad shoulders. My view of the case is the correct one. And 
yet, without a harshness which was foreign to his nature, it was impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman, tall, graceful, and queenly, who presented herself at Baker Street late in the evening, and implored his assistance and advice. "You 
didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. "We have not heard your story, and we 
cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side. I am so sorry about it. To make it the more extraordinary, there was no side road at this point down which he could have gone. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. The whole town must be alight. Brunton then unlocked the box, handed up the contents presumably--since they were not to be found--and then--and then what happened?  "What smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into flame in this passionate Celtic woman's soul when she saw the man who had wronged her--wronged her, perhaps, far more than we suspected--in her power? Was it a chance that the wood had slipped, and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become his sepulchre? Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate? Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing down into its place? Be that as it might, I seemed to see that woman's figure still clutching at her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair, with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover's life out. "Here was the secret of her blanched face, her 
shaken nerves, her peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning. "  Challenger chuckled and rubbed his hands. "I will venture a rover with you, or 
try long-butts or hoyles," said old Johnston. "  "Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?" asked the Inspector. The one at his elbow is Fernando de Castro, who is as brave and true a man as heart could wish. There was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. That 
night--I am still speaking of the first day of our circumnavigation of the plateau--a great experience awaited us, and one which for ever set at rest any doubt which we could have had as to the wonders so near us. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him. As to this terrible 
person of yours, where is he?"  "I rather fancy that he is on the stair," said Holmes, serenely. The double 
line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. From the time that I heard of the assistant having 
come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation. "  "If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it. Let those go back who will, but I 
must see more of these Spaniards ere I turn. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him?'  "'So, you're one of those damned touts!' cried the lad. Baker?"  "Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat. "  He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. Tell Aylward, Alleyne, that he is to come with me to Montaubon, and to choose one archer for his comrade. The rest will to Dax when the prince starts, which will be before the feast of the Epiphany. I stood for a few minutes with my heart in my boots, wondering whether the whole thing was an elaborate hoax or not, when up came a man and addressed me. "Pray, what did 
you do then?" he murmured. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant. The rest will to Dax 
when the prince starts, which will be before the feast of the Epiphany. Hardly yet have we learned the full tale of disaster, but the destruction by fire of New York, of Orleans, and of Brighton constitutes in itself one of the greatest tragedies in the history of our race. When the account of the railway and shipping accidents has been completed, it will furnish grim reading, although there is evidence to show that in the vast majority of cases the drivers of trains and engineers of steamers succeeded in shutting off their motive power before succumbing to the poison. "  The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?"  "They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door. The various checks which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion. The police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin--he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago--actually addressed him as he waited at the station. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Over the gently rising plain curved the white road which leads inland, usually flecked with travellers, but now with scarce a living form upon it, so completely had the lists drained all the district of its inhabitants. The enormously thick walls and tiny 
windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing, and the old one was used now as a store-house and a cellar, when it was used at all. He had always a taste for low company. Then he 
staggered to his feet, received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. "I have told you all I know. 
I have already looked into the matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution. My senses swam, but I still tore at the hand and forced it out from my chin. As I turned 
I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and frantic eyes. "Dear knights and gentlemen," he cried in a high crackling 
voice, "worthy Christian cavaliers, will ye ride past and leave an aged pilgrim to die of hunger? The sight hast been burned from mine eyes by the sands of the Holy Land, and I have had neither crust of bread nor cup of wine these two days past. "Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside. "My dear chap, I'm overjoyed to see you. Watson, could tell you that we are very busy at present. "  "It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less for you, perhaps, than for your sister. "My, but that was smart!  You had it down

I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. In spite of the danger from dinosaurs (which is not great 
save at night, for, as I may have said before, they are mostly nocturnal in their habits) I have twice in the last three weeks been over to our old camp in order to see our negro who still kept watch and ward below the cliff. He turned to me, and I felt the tide of life stealing warmly through my arteries. "  I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress of truth upon it. "  "Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Holmes swept his

she was cleaning out Sir Charles's study--it had never been touched since his death--and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. Do not be so suspicious. Holmes. To my horror I perceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with crimson. "  The bowman shook his head. You would have wished to tell me something, or in 
your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. So! Beat high and low among the heather, and a pot of wine to the lucky marksman. "  They were not long in coming. "Let me see that letter you were writing. "  The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. I can give you his description, and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark. He fired and missed me. "  "Here are paper and pen. No, I fancy we shall get no help here. "  "What then?"  "We shall get out at Canterbury. "  "Can we? It is not so easy as you seem to think. Then he reseated himself in 
his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. They were but a foraging party--a hundred archers and as many men-at-arms--but their leader was Sir Hugh Calverley, and he was not a man to bide idle when good blows were to be had not three leagues from him. "  "Exactly. When at last his ruffled feelings were at ease, he addressed us at some length from his seat upon a fallen tree, speaking, as his habit was, as if he were imparting most precious information to a class of a thousand. At last I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water. Again, 
in Arles and Nimes, and other towns that I could name, there are the great arches and fortalices still standing which were built of old by giant men who came from the south. How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?"  "Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them is quite possible in itself. I have it here in my pocket.

Had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you?"  "Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the examination. Oldacre kept himself

"It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry's--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probability--and so ran this man down. The first thing that strikes one is the

Friesland, a Dutch-American liner, which asserts that at nine next morning, Start Point being at the time ten miles upon their starboard quarter, they were passed by something between a flying goat and a monstrous bat, which was heading at a prodigious pace south and west.

to the lock, when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face. The old man lay back in his chair with a twitching face, and stared at her with brooding eyes. A broad leather 
strap hanging from his shoulder supported a scrip or satchel such as travellers were wont to carry. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee. Louis. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife. 'This is all quite beside the question. My boy, my boy, you are very

I have found them out. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. She would do

"'Consider, Sahib,' said he, 'that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them.

We were quietly married at a registry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded couple. Over this chaplet 
my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. As they passed over the drawbridge, Alleyne marked the gleam of arms in the embrasures to right and left, and they had scarce set foot upon the causeway ere a hoarse blare burst from a bugle, and, with screech of hinge and clank of chain, the ponderous bridge swung up into the air, drawn by unseen hands. And there we 
were, the four of us, upon the dreamland, the lost world, of Maple White. If such a knight as Sir Oliver Buttesthorn may turn against his own prince for the sake of a light word, then where are we to look for steadfast faith and constancy?"  "Ah! my dear little coz, it is easy to sit in the sunshine and preach to the man in the shadow. North, south, east, and west--he might turn where he would, but all was equally chill and cheerless. The Abbot had rolled ten silver crowns in a lettuce-leaf and hid them away in the bottom of his scrip, but that would be a sorry support for twelve long months. He had been dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end. For him the 
villain, for me the microbe. "You would have thought the middle of that prairie 
a fairly safe place for a man to be private," said he, "but, by thunder, the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?"  "I was on that hill. "A man can't expect always to have it his own way, can 
he, Dr. "It will bring YOU into the dock, Holmes, not me. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. It is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death--traces which, for some reason, must have pointed to him. Clair has 
entered it never to leave it more. As to Mrs. For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. Why was that?"  "We played cards for her on the voyage. "Or thought he did, which is quite 
another matter. Simeon and the Devil. '"  "Or the 'Jest of Hendy Tobias. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"  "That is better," said John Clay serenely. "Why should I not? And yet I hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life. "It has done harm to many and good to none--not even to yourself. Are you hungry, 
Watson?"  "Not particularly. Wilson? Have you a family?'  "I answered that I had not. "His face fell immediately. "'Dear me!' he said 
gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. In that gloomy tunnel it 
must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you. That he could play pieces, and 
difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites. "Holmes!" I cried--"Holmes!"  "Come out," said he, "and please be careful with the revolver. "Holmes!" in 
the insistent tone of one who awakens a sleeper. "Can't you hear me, Holmes?"  There was a rustling, as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder. "  "I guess you'll pay for this, Captain Marvin," said McGinty. Her bed this 
morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. He sat forward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an answering smile upon his bold, handsome face. Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was 
guilty. They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard, those of Barclay and of his wife. In the open, and near the edge of the cliff, there had 
assembled a crowd of some hundred of these shaggy, red-haired creatures, many of them of immense size, and all of them horrible to look upon. Percy Phelps," 
answered Holmes. "Ah, my unfortunate nephew! You can understand that our 
kinship makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. I fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon his career. "  Holmes considered for some little time. Then as the air became perceptibly 
better, but our own symptoms more acute, he closed it once again. He was the last man in the world whose deliberate command I should care to disobey. In this I fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. "Why," I cried, "you have an aortic 
aneurism!"  "That's what they call it," he said, placidly. Who could come to-night? Some 
friend of yours, perhaps?"  "Except yourself I have none," he answered. I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. I 
understand that this other passage leads only to the professor's room. A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the path, and bounded over into the chasm. Harding would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a newcomer, who could give us no information. I am, as you have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. This cloud 
continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In order to 
negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this Mr. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of 
them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. " He suddenly gave her a resounding kiss, which embarrassed me even more than his violence had done. "You've seen the postman. The woman looked at him intently, and ground her heel into his upturned face. "By my faith! Sir John," said the prince as he 
rode through the winding streets on his way to the list, "I should have been glad to have splintered a lance to-day. I remember such a one in Picardy, with a name as 
long as a Gascon's pedigree. No, sir, I'll not believe it. "  "Thank you, that will do," said Holmes. "  "What is the alley like?"  "There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable. "  "Then let us go and look at the room. "Well, I really can wait no longer. "  "Certainly," answered my friend, rising from his chair. He comes from Hordle, 
and this is his mother who hath come forth to welcome him. What would he do?"  "Come again next night with a more useful tool. "  "I think I should back my little friend," said Lord John, caressing his Express. CHAPTER XXVI. HOW THE BAILIFF OF SOUTHAMPTON SLEW THE TWO MASTERLESS 
MEN. St. Clair's house. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. "  Never in my life have I seen such a sight. For years I had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career. Once only he paused in his patient investigation. There were folk, 
too, to be met upon the road--beggars and couriers, chapmen and tinkers--cheery fellows for the most part, with a rough jest and homely greeting for each other and for Alleyne. What is it for?"  "It is the side entrance for trades-people. I do not know. I could not help 
smiling at the document when I had completed it. "But when one gets old one has 
a longing for home. "  "What is the meaning of it all, Mr. I need not say that I rushed for my coat and my hat. "  "You will excuse me, Mr. By the side of the track the old dame was standing, fastening her red whimple once more round her head. Yet, ere the last string had twanged, he would be down on his four bones among the stricken, and have them all houseled and shriven, as quick as shelling peas. "  There was a rustle among the bowmen, but when Sir Nigel looked up at them no man stood forward from his fellows, but the four lines of men stretched unbroken as before. The more deeply sunk impression is, of course, the hind wheel, upon which the weight rests. And yet, as he had guessed, the 
game was not over yet. You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them. Might I ask you, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge of the straw?"  I did so, and driven by the draught a coil of gray smoke swirled down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed. "Now we must see if we 
can find this witness for you, Lestrade. It was my turn to jump out of my 
chair. "  "One moment," said Holmes. "Why not?"  "Because I always keep faith. "It has done harm to many and good to none--not even to yourself. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. "  "And then?"  "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter. As they turned to the car Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. I did not know which way to turn or what I should do first. In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife. A taxicab was waiting at the end of the road, so I sprang into it and drove down to the office. ' I have spent an instructive afternoon in the 
rector's library, and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the United States. I hereby banish it completely from my 
presence. "  "Do not lose an instant. "Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. "  "Then I'd better try my luck with the original. "By Saint James! it is now my turn to show you where my weapon has the better of you. You have 
seen me hold a spear since I had strength to lift one, and should know best whether I do not merit a place among this honorable company. "  "Nay, nay," he answered; "ye must not bide for me, for where I go I stay. "You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I can for you in return. The woman looked at him intently, and ground her heel into his upturned face. As to the feuds of the two learned men, they are continuous and bitter. "   Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been reflected upon my features. There are evidently only two of them in it. They shower down arrows, darts and great stones. But there was no sound save the howling of the wind, and no movement but the swaying branches above them. "  "Thank you," said Holmes. A quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Gregson of Scotland Yard. "I think we have done all that can be done," he answered; "it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things. The man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle. " He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair. It is quite clear that the colonel was 
a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. He, however, blinking with puckered eyes, reached up his kerchief, and flicked the beast twice across the snout with it. "Ah, saucy! saucy," quoth he, with gentle chiding; on which the bear, uncertain and puzzled, dropped its four legs to earth again, and, waddling back, was soon swathed in ropes by the bear-ward and a crowd of peasants who had been in close pursuit. And with an 
apology he followed the Inspector outside. ADVENTURE II. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS  When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. THIS is not the place to 
commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. "  "But how could you guess what the motive was?"  "Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. "  "It was clamped to the floor. Not a word would our captive say, but he glared 
at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. "  "And how have you succeeded?"  "Well. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. One has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state. There was the point from which all my adventures started. I think we might drive round to the offices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day's work to a conclusion. It was to set her up in a typewriting business. But here are our comrades, Sir Nigel, and here is our camp. Who is this travel-stained youth who dares to ride so madly through the lines of staring burghers? Why does he fling himself from his horse and stare so strangely about him? See how he has rushed through the incense-bearers, thrust aside lay-sister Agatha, scattered the two-and-twenty damosels who sang so sweetly--and he stands before the novice with his hands out-stretched, and his face shining, and the light of love in his gray eyes. "  "Lord Holdhurst!"  "Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally destroyed. "  "By a singular and happy chance, we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question. Holmes, but when I 
thought of all the precaution I had taken to shield this girl--for I loved her, Mr. "  "For example?"  "I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. It was a 
remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin, and a humorous mouth. Probably he acted as I suggest. It must have lasted for 
some time, for it was then that these cigars were smoked. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. In the jungle I crept forward, stopping with a beating heart whenever I heard, as I often did, the crash of breaking branches as some wild beast went past. I say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. " He raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it. "Put 
into plain words, the matter is this," said he. When the fellow comes speak to 
him in an ordinary way. "When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it was to Miss S. "I don't go," said Austin. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. "  "Excellent. Laura Lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her. "  "Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case. Holmes read it and was about to place it in his 
notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. The letter--for it was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. The 
nurse-girl slapped one of her charges and then began to push the perambulator up the hill. The window, I may add, 
was not large enough for a man to get through. Ill armed and half starved, they were still desperate men, to 
whom danger had lost all fears: for what was death that they should shun it to cling to such a life as theirs? The castle was theirs, and the roaring flames were spurting through the windows and flickering high above the turrets on two sides of the quadrangle. From either side they were sweeping down from room to room and from bastion to bastion in the direction of the keep. Gradually, as time passed, his fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed his former habits, when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of prostration in which he now lies. "What happened was this. "Well, it's at the bottom of this oxygen 
business, or I am mistaken," said I. "A good cyclist does not need a high road. "  "Not only a fellow-countryman, my good sir," said Challenger, "but also, if I may be allowed to enlarge your simile, an ally of the first value. "I can see the pennons of De Couvette, De Brieux, Saint Pol, and many others who struck in against us for Charles of Blois. "  "You can't help me. For the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not 
cure. At last I determined to see them before I died. For a moment I thought that I had thrown him off. His hands were raised, and he seemed to be settling his necktie. The tall man leaned heavily upon her to take the 
weight off his tender foot, while he held his burden betwixt himself and the wall, cuddling it jealously to his side, and thrusting forward his young companion to act as a buttress whenever the pressure of the crowd threatened to bear him away. "  "I should have thought that even a limited knowledge of comparative anatomy would have helped to verify it," said Summerlee, bitterly. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. One would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. Did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared?"  "No. But my own views are different. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. You may possibly 
have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. "  "This sounds well. "  "Have you any reason to suspect robbery?"  "No, sir. The inspector looked honestly interested. Mortimer, the gardener, 
who wheels the Bath chair, is an army pensioner--an old Crimean man of excellent character. There is this 
naturalist, Stapleton, and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. I had 
at that time just entered the family of Mrs. "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; 
"it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. "  "Well, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time," said the inspector. "Well, well, give him 
that message. I had lost my hold on Black Peter and was stranded in London without a shilling. Even now I see what you have done, but I don't know how you did it or what it signifies. "He will come to anon," said the knight, stooping over him and 
passing his fingers through his hair. His room was on the second floor and was 
approached through another larger room, in which two boys were sleeping. Holmes disregarded the 
outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Alleyne stood still in the roadway for a few minutes 
reflecting upon what he should do. But when it came to almagest and astrolabe, the 
counting of figures and reckoning of epicycles, away would go her thoughts to horse and hound, and a vacant eye and listless face would warn the teacher that he had lost his hold upon his scholar. Solemnity and humility are at the 
base of all our emotions to-day. May they be the foundations upon which a more earnest and reverent race may build a more worthy temple. Hence the cocaine. What Alleyne 
saw and wondered at in Hampshire would have appealed equally to the traveller in any other English county from the Channel to the marches of Scotland. That the writer was on board of a 
ship. You are in safe hands. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Afterwards he read 
the Daily Herald. He would naturally use the first words which came to his 
mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or interested in breeding. "How is that?" I asked when I had finished. "Five years altogether. "  "He was a bachelor, you say?"  "A widower. Takes you as cramp, I fancy. "  "Yes, yes; it is cramp. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the station, and we 
were soon whirling up in a Portsmouth train. "Ah, yes, of course. The medical evidence 
showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy. Holmes seemed to know the grounds perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees, I close at his heels, and our foremost pursuer panting behind us. I have several fresh dancing-men pictures for you to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow. There is 
no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. '  "'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. Where are you from?'  "'Then I shall never see her. "Here it is, Mr. Suddenly, however, a flash of intelligence had come over his sodden features, and he rose and staggered for the door. The Frenchman, whirling up his sword, showed for an 
instant a chink betwixt his shoulder piece and the rerebrace which guarded his upper arm. " He walked to the French window and threw it open. But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times. "Lewes is ablaze!"  "No, it is Brighton which is burning," said Challenger, stepping across to join us. "You can see the curved back of the downs against the glow. "  "My dear fellow! I congrat----"  "To Milverton's housemaid. "I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke. "  "The killing of Mortimer Tregennis," said Holmes. His pension was due. Mr. 
Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart. Here are the symbols. "  As he spoke the attendant cantered up the grassy enclosure, and pulling up his steed in front of the royal stand, blew a second fanfare upon his bugle. "We doubt not, with the help of God, to see you very soon restored to those thrones from which you have been so traitorously thrust. "Our rate at 
present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour. "The case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than I had originally thought. Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum 
which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?"  "There you make a mistake, Mr. I kept the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. "  "Yes?"  "The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. Yet the fact remains that the 
reader, who was a fine, robust old man, was knocked clean down by it as if it had been the butt end of a pistol. The teachings of twenty years cried out against such license. 
Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. "  "Forget what?"  "Well, about Victor Savage's death. Then he took out the key, which was on the 
inside, and inspected that also. I've been making a few independent inquiries, you see. " He chuckled with glee at the prospect. "  "And you, Summerlee?"  "We seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition, Lord John. Simon glanced over it. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings. "  "A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery. We have all faced 
death together before now. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room. You carve too?"  The youth's pale face flushed with the pride of the skilled workman. I saw the 
man, too, in the gloom. He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan. Here came the merchandise of all the 
fair countries which are watered by the Garonne and the Dordogne--the cloths of the south, the skins of Guienne, the wines of the Medoc--to be borne away to Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol or Chester, in exchange for the wools and woolfels of England. Henceforward events were too swift and too poignant to allow me to write, but they are too clearly outlined in my memory that any detail could escape me. Some chokiness in my 
throat made me look at the oxygen cylinders, and I was startled at what I saw. As a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good 
stroke of business are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. "  There was silence in the room. Three undetected murders in one year won't do, Lestrade. Strange that now in its old age this dark 
business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked roofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue. We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now 
found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The wagonette was paid off and ordered 
to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House. "Ride by my 
side, friends, I entreat of you," said the knight, reining in his steed that they might come abreast of him. "For, since it hath pleased you to follow me to the wars, it were well that you should know how you may best serve me. "  "By St. "  "A roaring, raging bully!"  "That's done it!  Stool of penance!" said he. "  "And he was well dressed?"  "Very smartly dressed, sir--quite the gentleman. "  "But I understand that there was a considerable wound. When you spoke last 
night of taking precautions I remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in England to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention--which shows that I have still much to learn. A good shoot for you 
also, John! The villain hath fallen forward into the fire. A white surcoat with the lion of St. The sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window. The deep shout of Du Guesclin, the 
hard, hissing breath of the pressing multitude, the clatter of steel, the thud of falling bodies, and the screams of the stricken, made up such a medley as came often in after years to break upon Alleyne's sleep. "Now, let 
us calmly define our position, Watson," he continued as we skirted the cliffs together. We ain't nervous folk, as you know well; but when it comes to makin' a week-end visit and finding you've run full butt into the Day of Judgment, it wants a bit of explainin'. '  "'If there were only one,' he said. " There is the first volume of it in that press. The Abbot stood by the narrow window, and his long 
black shadow fell slantwise across the rush-strewn floor. Only above the eyebrows, where the 
sloping forehead and low, curved skull of the ape-man were in sharp contrast to the broad brow and magnificent cranium of the European, could one see any marked difference. At that moment there arrived Dr. It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady's adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent trees. The eyes, which were under thick and heavy brows, were bestial and ferocious, and as it opened its mouth to snarl what sounded like a curse at me I observed that it had curved, sharp canine teeth. To-day I was not alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find out who he was and what he wanted. I slowed down my machine, but he slowed down his. Have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this German master?"  "None at all. How now, coz, have I touched thee on the raw?"  Alleyne sat between them munching his bread, while the twain disputed across his knees, leaning forward with flushed faces and darting hands, in all the heat of argument. "By Gar!" he cried, "I've got him. "The 
windows are all lighting up, and you'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes. Now we may use the eyes which God hath given us. 'See that the boy has this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.
