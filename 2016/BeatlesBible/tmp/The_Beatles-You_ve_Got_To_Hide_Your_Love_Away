 Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away<br/>Hey, you've got to hide your love away<br/><br/>How can I even try?<br/>I can never win<br/>Hearing them, seeing them<br/>In the state I'm in<br/><br/>How could she say to me<br/>Love will find a way?<br/>Gather round, all you clowns<br/>Let me hear you say<br/><br/>Hey, you've got to hide your love away<br/>Hey, you've got to hide your love away
