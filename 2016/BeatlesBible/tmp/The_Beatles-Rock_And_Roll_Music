 Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast<br/>And lose the beauty of the melody<br/>Until it sounds just like a symphony<br/><br/>That's why I go for that rock and roll music<br/>Any old way you choose it<br/>It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br/>Any old time you use it<br/>It's gotta be rock-roll music<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/><br/>I took my love on over 'cross the tracks<br/>And she declaim a man a wailin' sax<br/>I must admit they had a rockin' band<br/>Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'<br/><br/>That's why I go for that rock and roll music<br/>Any old way you choose it<br/>It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br/>Any old time you use it<br/>Gotta be rock and roll music<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/><br/>Way down South they had a jubilee<br/>Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree<br/>They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup<br/>The folks were dancin' and got all shook up<br/><br/>And started playin' that rock and roll music<br/>Any old time you use it<br/>It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br/>Any old time you use it<br/>Gotta be rock-roll music<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/><br/>Don't care to hear them play a tango<br/>I'm in no mood to take a mambo<br/>It's way too early for a congo<br/>So keep on rockin' that piano<br/><br/>That's why I go for that rock and roll music<br/>Any old time you use it<br/>It's got a black beat, you can't lose it<br/>Any old time you use it<br/>Oughta got rock-roll music<br/>If you wanna dance with me<br/>If you wanna dance with me
