 If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
Big and black the clouds may be<br/>Time will pass away<br/>If you put your trust in me<br/>I'll make bright your day<br/>Look into these eyes now<br/>Tell me what you see<br/>Don't you realise now?<br/>What you see is me<br/><br/>Tell me what you see<br/><br/>Listen to me one more time<br/>How can I get through?<br/>Can't you try to see that I'm<br/>Tryin' to get to you?<br/>Open up your eyes now<br/>Tell me what you see<br/>It is no surprise now<br/>What you see is me<br/><br/>Tell me what you see<br/><br/>Listen to me one more time<br/>How can I get through?<br/>Can't you try to see that I'm<br/>Tryin' to get to you?<br/>Open up your eyes now<br/>Tell me what you see<br/>It is no surprise now<br/>What you see is me
