 To me
Coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word
That I heard
Call me morbid or absurd
But to me
Coming from you
Friend is a four letter word<br/><br/>To me<br/>Coming from you<br/>Friend is a four letter word<br/>End is the only part of the word<br/>That I heard<br/>Call me morbid or absurd<br/>But to me<br/>Coming from you<br/>Friend is a four letter word<br/><br/>When I go fishing for the words<br/>I am wishing you would say to me<br/>I am really only praying that<br/>The words you'll soon be saying<br/>Might betray the way you feel about me<br/><br/>But to me<br/>Coming from you<br/>Friend is a four letter word
