The world is treating me bad
Misery
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad
Misery
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag
Misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one?
Only one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one
Lonely one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
In misery
My misery
Misery
