 I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine
My happiness, dear, makes me cry
And in time<br/>You'll understand the reason why<br/>If I cry, it's not because I'm sad<br/>But you're the only love that I've ever had<br/><br/>I can't believe<br/>It's happened to me<br/>I can't conceive<br/>Of any more <br/>Misery<br/><br/>Ask me why<br/>I'll say I love you<br/>And I'm always thinking of you<br/><br/>I love you<br/>'Cause you tell me things I want to know<br/>And it's true<br/>That it really only goes to show<br/>That I know that I<br/>Should never, never, never be blue<br/><br/>Ask me why<br/>I'll say I love you<br/>And I'm always thinking of you<br/><br/>I can't believe<br/>It's happened to me<br/>I can't conceive<br/>Of any more <br/>Misery<br/><br/>Ask me why<br/>I'll say I love you<br/>And I'm always thinking of you<br/>You<br/>You
