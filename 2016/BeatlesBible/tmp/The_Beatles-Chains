Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah
Chains
Well, I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around
'Cause I'm not free
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Won't let me be, yeah
I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these
Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah
Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah
Chains
Chains of love
Chains of love
Chains of love
