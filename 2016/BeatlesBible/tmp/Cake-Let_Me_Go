 When she walks, she swings her arms
instead of her hips
When she talks, she moves her mouth
instead of her lips
And I've waited for her for so long
I've waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on, yeah
Let me go she said, let me go she said<br/>Let me go and I will want you more,<br/>Let me go she said,<br/>Let me go<br/>Let me go and I will want you<br/><br/>When she wants, she wants the sun<br/>instead of the moon<br/>When she sees, she see the stars<br/>inside of her room<br/><br/>Let me go she said (x3) and I will want you more,<br/>Let me go she said<br/>Let me go,<br/>Let me go and I will want you<br/>Let me go she said (x2)<br/>Let me go, let me go she said,<br/>Let me go, let me go,<br/>Let me golet me go,<br/>Let me go, let let me go,<br/>Let me go, let me go,<br/>Let me go, let me go
