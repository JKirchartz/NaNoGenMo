Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Please please me, whoa, yeah
Like I please you
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say "love"?
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Please please me, whoa, yeah
Like I please you
I don't wanna sound complainin'
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasin' with you, it's so hard to reason
With you, whoa yeah
Why do you make me blue?
