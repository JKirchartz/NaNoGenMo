 This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through
Your window
I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me 'cause I looked up to see
Your face
I tried to telephone, they said you were not home<br/>That's a lie<br/>'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in<br/>Your door<br/><br/>I nearly died<br/>I nearly died<br/>'Cause you walked hand in hand with another man<br/>In my place<br/><br/>If I were you I'd realise that I<br/>Love you more than any other guy<br/>And I'll forgive the lies that I<br/>Heard before when you gave me no reply<br/><br/>I've tried to telephone, they said you were not home<br/>That's a lie<br/>'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in<br/>Your door<br/><br/>I nearly died<br/>I nearly died<br/>'Cause you walked hand in hand<br/>With another man in my place<br/><br/>No reply<br/>No reply
