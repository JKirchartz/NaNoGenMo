 I am intrinsically no good
I have a heart that's made of wood
I am only biding time
Only reciting memorized lines
And I'm not fit to touch
The hem of your garment
No, no I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment
I have no love, but only goals
How very empty is my soul<br/>It is a soul that feels no thrill<br/>A soul that could easily kill<br/>And I'm not fit to touch<br/>The hem of your garment<br/><br/>No, no I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment<br/><br/>I am intrinsically no good<br/>I have a heart that's made of wood<br/>I am only biding time<br/>Only reciting memorized lines<br/>And I'm not fit to touch<br/>The hem of your garment<br/><br/>I am intrinsically no good<br/>I have a heart that's made of wood<br/>I am only biding time<br/>Only reciting memorized lines<br/>And I'm not fit to touch<br/>The hem of your garment<br/><br/>No, no I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment<br/>The hem of your garment
