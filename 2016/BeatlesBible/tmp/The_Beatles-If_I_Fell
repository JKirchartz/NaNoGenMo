 If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure<br/>From the very start<br/>That you<br/>Would love me more than her<br/><br/>If I trust in you<br/>Oh, please<br/>Don't run and hide<br/>If I love you too<br/>Oh, please<br/>Don't hurt my pride like her<br/>'Cause I couldn't stand the pain<br/>And I<br/>Would be sad if our new love<br/>Was in vain<br/><br/>So I hope you see<br/>That I<br/>Would love to love you<br/>And that she<br/>Will cry<br/>When she learns we are two<br/>'Cause I couldn't stand the pain<br/>And I would be sad if our new love<br/>Was in vain<br/><br/>So I hope you see<br/>That I<br/>Would love to love you<br/>And that she<br/>Will cry<br/>When she learns we are two<br/>If I fell in love with you
