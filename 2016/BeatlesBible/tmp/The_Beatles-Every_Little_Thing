 When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does<br/>She does for me, ooh<br/><br/>When I'm with her I'm happy<br/>Just to know that she loves me<br/>Yes, I know that she loves me now<br/>There is one thing I'm sure of<br/>I will love her forever<br/>For I know love will never die<br/><br/>Every little thing she does<br/>She does for me, yeah<br/>And you know the things she does<br/>She does for me, ooh<br/><br/>Every little thing she does<br/>She does for me, yeah<br/>And you know the things she does<br/>She does for me, ooh<br/><br/>Every little thing<br/>Every little thing
