1. Beatles Bible
Music has always been a religious experience for me, perhaps easily referencable
lyrics will have an effect on future theologians.

post-mortem: Internet Connectivity issues made it nearly impossible to download the complete corpus.

2. Nova
IDK yet, but I love this show

3. Sherlock Shuffle
Take a selection of Sherlock Holmes books, and shuffle them like a deck of
cards. (Might resort to Markov)


Bonus: Library of Babel
A seedable web presentation of Borges classic Library of Lore
