# NaNoGenMo 2015

These are the scripts I'm going to use to generate a few "novels," of around
50,000 words each. I will not be including any copyrighted materials in this
repository, but will be generating texts from potentially copyrighted materials;
any applicable copyright remains with it's author/creator.


1. Beatles Bible
Music has always been a religious experience for me, perhaps easily referencable
lyrics will have an effect on future theologians.

2. Nova
IDK yet, but I love this show

3. Sherlock Shuffle
Take a selection of Sherlock Holmes books, and shuffle them like a deck of
cards. (Might resort to Markov)


Bonus: Library of Babel
A seedable web presentation of Borges classic Library of Lore
