Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving
In the car
It makes my baby seem so far
I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat<br/><br/>But when we're driving in my Malibu<br/>It's easy to get right next to you<br/>I say, "Baby, scoot over please"<br/>And then she's right there next to me<br/>I need you here with me<br/>Not way over in a bucket seat<br/>I need you to be here with me<br/>Not way over in a bucket seat<br/><br/>Well, a lot of good cars<br/>Are Japanese<br/>But when we're driving far<br/>I need my baby, I need my baby<br/>Next to me<br/><br/>Well, stickshifts and safetybelts<br/>Bucket seats have all got to go<br/>When we're driving in the car<br/>It makes my baby seem so far<br/>I need you here with me<br/>Not way over in a bucket seat<br/>I need you to be here with me<br/>Not way over in a bucket seat
