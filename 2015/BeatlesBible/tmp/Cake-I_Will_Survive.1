 At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along
And so you're back<br/>From outer space<br/>I just walked in to find you<br/>Here without that look upon your face<br/>I should have changed my fucking lock<br/>I would have made you leave your key<br/>If I'd have known for just one second<br/>You'd be back to bother me<br/><br/>Oh now go<br/>Walk out the door<br/>Just turn around now<br/>You're not welcome anymore<br/>Weren't you the one<br/>Who tried to break me with desire?<br/>Did you think I'd crumble?<br/>Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br/><br/>Oh not I<br/>I will survive<br/>Yeah<br/>As long as I know how to love<br/>I know I'll be alive<br/>I've got all my life to live<br/>I've got all my love to give<br/>I will survive<br/>I will survive<br/>Yeah, yeah<br/><br/>It took all the strength I had<br/>Just not to fall apart<br/>I'm trying hard to mend the pieces<br/>Of my broken heart<br/>And I spent oh so many nights<br/>Just feeling sorry for myself<br/>I used to cry<br/>But now I hold my head up high<br/><br/>And you see me<br/>With somebody new<br/>I'm not that stupid little person<br/>Still in love with you<br/>And so you thought you'd just drop by<br/>And you expect me to be free<br/>But now I'm saving all my lovin'<br/>For someone who's lovin' me<br/><br/>Oh now go<br/>Walk out the door<br/>Just turn around now<br/>You're not welcome anymore<br/>Weren't you the one<br/>Who tried to break me with desire?<br/>Did you think I'd crumble?<br/>Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br/><br/>Oh not I<br/>I will survive<br/>Yeah<br/>As long as I know how to love<br/>I know I'll be alive<br/>I've got all my life to live<br/>I've got all my love to give<br/>I will survive<br/>I will survive<br/>Yeah, yeah<br/>Da da, da da, da da dada...<br/>Da, da, da, da, dada dada dada dada<br/>...<br/>Oh no
