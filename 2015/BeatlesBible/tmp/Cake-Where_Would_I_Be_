 I've been waiting for so long
I've been hoping your love's not gone
Houses are sliding in the mud
Rivers are raging in your blood
Where would I be without your love?
Where would I be without your arms around me?
You want to be the only one 
If I knew you I would not run
You have been cloudy, distant, dark<br/>I'm thinking of Noah and the ark<br/><br/>Where would I be without your love?<br/>Where would I be without your arms around me?<br/><br/>Where would I be without your love?<br/>Where would I be without your arms around me?
