 Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried<br/>And why you lied to me<br/>Tell me why you cried<br/>And why you lied to me<br/><br/>If it's something I'd have said or done<br/>Tell me what and I'll apologise<br/>If you don't, I really can't go on<br/>Holding back these tears in my eyes<br/><br/>Tell me why you cried<br/>And why you lied to me<br/>Tell me why you cried<br/>And why you lied to me<br/><br/>Well, I beggin' on my bended knees<br/>If you'll only listen to my please<br/>Is there anything that I can do?<br/>'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you<br/><br/>Tell me why you cried<br/>And why you lied to me<br/>Tell me why you cried<br/>And why you lied to me
