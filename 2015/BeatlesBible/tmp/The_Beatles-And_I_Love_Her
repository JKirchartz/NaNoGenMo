 I give her all my love, that's all I do
And if you saw my love, you'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything and tenderly
The kiss my lover brings, she brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky<br/>I know this love of mine will never die<br/>And I love her<br/><br/>Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky<br/>I know this love of mine will never die<br/>And I love her
