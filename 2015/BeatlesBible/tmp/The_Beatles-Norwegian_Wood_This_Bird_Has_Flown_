 I once had a girl or should I say
She once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good
Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said:<br/>"It's time for bed"<br/><br/>She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh<br/>I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br/><br/>And when I awoke I was alone<br/>This bird had flown<br/>So I lit a fire, isn't it good<br/>Norwegian wood?
