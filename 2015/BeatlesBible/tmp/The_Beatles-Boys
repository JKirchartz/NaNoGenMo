 I've been told when a boy kiss a girl
Take a trip around the world
Hey, hey (bop shoo-wop, mbop-bop shoo-wop)
Hey, hey (bop shoo-wop, mbop-bop shoo-wop)
Hey, hey (bop shoo-wop, mbop-bop shoo-wop)
Yeah, she say you do (bop shoo-wop)
My girl says when I kiss her lips
Gets a thrill through her fingertips (ow!)
