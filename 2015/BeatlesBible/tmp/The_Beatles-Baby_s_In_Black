 Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue<br/>Tell me, oh what can I do?<br/><br/>I think of her<br/>But she thinks only of him<br/>And though it's only a whim<br/>She thinks of him<br/><br/>Oh, how long will it take<br/>Till she sees the mistake she has made?<br/><br/>Dear, what can I do?<br/>Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue<br/>Tell me, oh, what can I do?<br/><br/>Oh, how long will it be<br/>Till she sees the mistake she has made?<br/><br/>Dear, what can I do?<br/>Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue<br/>Tell me, oh, what can I do?<br/><br/>She thinks of him<br/>And so she dresses in black<br/>And though he'll never come back<br/>She's dressed in black<br/><br/>Oh dear, what can I do?<br/>Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue<br/>Tell me, oh what can I do?
