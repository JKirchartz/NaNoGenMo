 I bombed Korea every night
My engine sang into the salty sky
I didn't know if I would live or die
I bombed Korea every night
I bombed Korea every night
Oh, I bombed Korea every night
Red flowers bursting down below us
Those people didn't even know us
We didn't know if we would live or die<br/>We didn't know if it was wrong or right<br/>I bombed Korea every night<br/><br/>And so I sit here at this bar<br/>I'm not a hero; I'm not a movie star<br/>I've got my beer; I've got my stories to tell<br/>But they wont tell you what it's like in hell<br/>Red flowers bursting down below us<br/>Those people didn't even know us<br/>We didn't know if we would live or die<br/>We didn't know if it was wrong or right<br/>We didn't know if we would live or die<br/>I bombed Korea every night... oh yeah, it's true
