 Since she's been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame
It's plain to see
So go away and leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe<br/>That she would leave<br/>Me on my own<br/>It's just not right<br/>When every night<br/>I'm all alone<br/><br/>I've got no time for you right now<br/>Don't bother me<br/><br/>I know I'll never be the same<br/>If I don't get her back again<br/>Because I know she'll always be<br/>The only girl for me<br/><br/>But 'til she's here<br/>Please don't come near<br/>Just stay away<br/>I'll let you know<br/>When she's come home<br/>Until that day<br/><br/>Don't come around, leave me alone<br/>Don't bother me<br/><br/>I've got no time for you right now<br/>Don't bother me<br/><br/>I know I'll never be the same<br/>If I don't get her back again<br/>Because I know she'll always be<br/>The only girl for me<br/><br/>But 'til she's here<br/>Please don't come near<br/>Just stay away<br/>I'll let you know<br/>When she's come home<br/>Until that day<br/><br/>Don't come around, leave me alone<br/>Don't bother me<br/>Don't bother me<br/>Don't bother me<br/>Don't bother me<br/>Don't bother me
