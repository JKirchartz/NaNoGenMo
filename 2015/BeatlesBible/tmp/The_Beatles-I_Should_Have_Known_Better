 I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine<br/>You're gonna say you love me too<br/><br/>So I should have realised a lot of things before<br/>If this is love you gotta give me more<br/>Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more<br/><br/>Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be<br/>This could only happen to me<br/>Can't you see, can't you see?<br/><br/>That when I tell you that I love you, oh<br/>You're gonna say you love me too, oh<br/>And when I ask you to be mine<br/>You're gonna say you love me too<br/>You love me too<br/>You love me too<br/>You love me too
