 Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me<br/>If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong<br/>'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong<br/>I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true<br/>'Cause you like me too much and I like you<br/><br/>'Cause you like me too much and I like you<br/>I really do and it's nice when you believe me<br/>If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong<br/>'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong<br/>I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true<br/>'Cause you like me too much and I like you<br/>'Cause you like me too much and I like you
