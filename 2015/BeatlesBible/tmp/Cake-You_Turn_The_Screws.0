 You turn the screws
You tear down the bridge
Flimsy as it is, it's business like
You shake my hand
You break up the band
Flimsy as it is, it's open-mike punk rock
Red white and blue (whoa)
You twist the knife then go home to kiss your wife
A bigger better slice is what you'd like<br/>You kick the sand, you get the upper hand<br/>You sell it to Japan <br/>It's natural punk rock<br/>Red white and blue (whoa)<br/><br/>You turn the screws<br/>It's what you choose to do<br/>You think that I <br/>Must turn them too<br/>You think that I must be so satisfied<br/>I stay inside<br/>I wonder why<br/><br/>And the cement mixer gets it all ready<br/>One good turn at a time<br/>They're pouring it slowly and steady<br/>You're showing me where I can sign<br/>What I can expect to find<br/>But how can you say you'll be happy <br/>When you turn the screws<br/><br/>You turn the screws<br/>It's what you choose to do<br/>You turn the screws<br/>It's what you choose to do<br/>You think I must turn them, too<br/>You turn the screws<br/>You tear down the bridge<br/>Flimsy as it is, it's business like<br/>Flimsy as it is, it's open-mike punk rock<br/>Red white and blue<br/>You turn the screws
