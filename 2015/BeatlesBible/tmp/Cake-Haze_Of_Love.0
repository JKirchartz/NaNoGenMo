 It's 3 o'clock in the morning
Or maybe it's 4
I'm thinking of you
Wondering what I should do
But I'm finally cutting 
Through this haze
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
Or maybe it's 5
I think I'm alive<br/>And I think I'll survive<br/>And I'm finally cutting <br/>Through this haze of love<br/>Haze of love<br/>For days and days<br/>I'm in a haze of love<br/><br/>Yea, you don't love me <br/>Like I love you<br/>Although you pretend, <br/>I can see this will end<br/>I'm finally cutting through <br/>This haze of love<br/>Haze of love<br/>For days and days and days <br/>I'm in a haze of love<br/><br/>It's 5 o'clock in the morning<br/>Or maybe it's 6<br/>I am sick of your lies<br/>I am sick of your tricks<br/>I am finally cutting through <br/>This haze of love<br/>Haze of love<br/>For days and days and days<br/>For days and days and days<br/>For days and days and days<br/>I'm in a haze of love.
