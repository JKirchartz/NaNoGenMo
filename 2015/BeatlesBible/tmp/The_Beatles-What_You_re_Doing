 Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you<br/>Wondering what you're gonna do<br/>And should you need a love that's true<br/>It's me<br/><br/>Please, stop your lying<br/>You got me crying, girl<br/>Why should it be so much to ask of you<br/>What you're doing to me?<br/><br/>I've been waiting here for you<br/>Wondering what you're gonna do<br/>And should you need a love that's true<br/>It's me<br/><br/>Please stop your lying<br/>You have got me crying, girl<br/>Why should it be so much to ask of you<br/>What you're doing to me?<br/>What you're doing to me<br/>What you're doing to me
