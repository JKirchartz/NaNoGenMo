 Cool blue reason empties on the page
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies enraged
Cool blue reason comes into your world
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change like seasons
Only 8 more hours to go (2x)
Only 8 more hours...left to go.
Cool blue reason comes into your life<br/>There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife<br/>Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself<br/>Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging hell<br/>I'm just talking to myself(2x)<br/><br/>Cool blue reason wraps around your throat<br/>The minutes change likes seasons<br/>Only 8 more hours to go (2x)<br/>Only 8 more hours...left to go
