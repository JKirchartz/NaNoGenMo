 You part the waters
The same ones that I'm drowning in
You lead your casual slaughters
And I'm the one who helps you win
You've got your grand piano
You don't even play piano
I'm the one who plays piano
You don't even play piano
You part the waters<br/>The same ones that I'm thirsty for<br/>You invite your friends to tea<br/>But when it's me you lock the door<br/>You've got your credit cards<br/>And you thank your lucky stars<br/>But don't forget the ones who foot the bill<br/><br/>You've got your grand piano<br/>And you don't even play piano<br/>I'm the one who plays piano<br/>You don't even play piano<br/>But you part the waters
