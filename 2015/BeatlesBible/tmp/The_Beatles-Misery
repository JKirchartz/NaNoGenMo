 The world is treating me bad
Misery
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad
Misery
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag<br/>Misery<br/><br/>I'll remember all the little things we've done<br/>Can't she see she'll always be the only one?<br/>Only one<br/><br/>Send her back to me<br/>'Cause everyone can see<br/>Without her I will be<br/>In misery<br/><br/>I'll remember all the little things we've done<br/>She'll remember and she'll miss her only one<br/>Lonely one<br/><br/>Send her back to me<br/>'Cause everyone can see<br/>Without her I will be<br/>In misery<br/>In misery<br/>My misery<br/>Misery
