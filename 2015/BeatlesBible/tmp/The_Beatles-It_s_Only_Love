 I get high when I see you go by
My, oh my
When you sigh, my my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy
When I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all<br/>But it's so hard loving you<br/><br/>Is it right that you and I should fight<br/>Every night?<br/>Just the sight of you makes night-time bright<br/>Very bright<br/>Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?<br/><br/>It's only love and that is all<br/>Why should I feel the way I do?<br/>It's only love and that is all<br/>But it's so hard loving you<br/>Yes, it's so hard loving you<br/>Loving you
