Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see<br/>That before too long<br/>I'd fall in love with her<br/>She wouldn't dance with another<br/>When I saw her standing there<br/><br/>Well, my heart went boom<br/>When I crossed that room<br/>And I held her hand in mine<br/><br/>Whoa, we danced through the night<br/>And we held each other tight<br/>And before too long<br/>I fell in love with her<br/>Now, I'll never dance with another<br/>When I saw her standing there<br/><br/>Well, my heart went boom<br/>When I crossed that room<br/>And I held her hand in mine<br/><br/>Oh, we danced through the night<br/>And we held each other tight<br/>And before too long<br/>I fell in love with her<br/>Now, I'll never dance with another<br/>Since I saw her standing there<br/>Whoa, since I saw her standing there<br/>Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
