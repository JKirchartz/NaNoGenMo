 Jesus wrote a blank check
One I haven't cashed quite yet
I hope I got a little more time
I hope it's not the end of the line
Yeah, Jesus wrote a blank check
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, all right
Well, if I had to choose a number
I'd want it to be number one
I don't want to be number two<br/>Yeah, I don't want to be number four<br/>Yeah, but I can hear a knock on the door<br/>Jesus wrote a blank check, all right<br/><br/>If Jesus saw me dying<br/>Would angels come a-flying down?<br/>I hope I got a little more time<br/>I hope somebody lends me a dime<br/>Now, Jesus wrote a blank check<br/>Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, uh-huh<br/><br/>Still I build my towers high<br/>I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky<br/>Still I wallow in the mire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire<br/><br/>Still I build my towers high<br/>I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky<br/>Still I wallow in the mire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire <br/><br/>Ah, still I burn this earthen fire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire<br/>Still I burn this earthen fire
