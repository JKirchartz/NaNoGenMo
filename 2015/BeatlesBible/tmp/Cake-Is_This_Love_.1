 I can't believe it's true.
I can't believe that you
Don't want me anymore.
You're with him, And you don't even know
That I've been dying all day long
And singing sad, sad songs
And wishing you were gone. 
Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Or should I close the door? <br/><br/>My eyes are burning in my head<br/>And seeing only red<br/>And wishing you were dead. <br/><br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Or should I,<br/>Or should I, should I,<br/>Should I close the door?<br/>Should I close the door? Ah, I fooled myself. <br/><br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Is this love?<br/>Or should I,<br/>Or should I,<br/>Or should I, should I,<br/>Should I close the door?
