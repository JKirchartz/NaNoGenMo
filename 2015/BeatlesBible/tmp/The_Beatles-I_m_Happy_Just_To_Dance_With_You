 Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny, try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night<br/>In this world there's nothing I would rather do<br/>'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you<br/><br/>Just to dance with you<br/>Is everything I need (oh-oh)<br/>Before this dance is through (oh)<br/>I think I'll love you too (oh-oh)<br/>I'm so happy when you dance with me (oh-oh ohh)<br/><br/>If somebody tries to take my place<br/>Let's pretend we just can't see his face<br/>In this world there's nothing I would rather do<br/>'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you<br/><br/>Just to dance with you (oh-oh)<br/>Is everything I need (oh-oh)<br/>Before this dance is through (oh)<br/>I think I'll love you too (oh-oh)<br/>I'm so happy when you dance with me (oh-oh ohh)<br/><br/>If somebody tries to take my place<br/>Let's pretend we just can't see his face<br/>In this world there's nothing I would rather do<br/>I've discovered I'm in love with you<br/>(Oh)<br/>'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you<br/>(Oh-oh)<br/>(Oh-oh)<br/>(Oh)
