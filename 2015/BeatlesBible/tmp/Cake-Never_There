 I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding
I need your love, so much
You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you 
(baby)
Baby, <br/>(you're never there)<br/><br/>On the phone long, long distance<br/>Always through such strong resistance<br/>First you say you're too busy<br/>I wonder if you even miss me<br/><br/>Never there<br/>You're never there<br/>You're never, ever, ever, ever there<br/><br/>A golden bird that flies away<br/>A candle's fickle flame<br/>To think I held you yesterday<br/>Your love was just a game<br/>A golden bird that flies away<br/>A candle's fickle flame<br/>To think I held you yesterday<br/>Your love was just a game<br/><br/>You tell me that you love me so<br/>You tell me that you care<br/>But when I need you <br/>(baby)<br/>Baby!<br/><br/>Take the time to get to know me<br/>If you want me why can't you just show me<br/>We're always on this roller coaster<br/>If you want me why can't you get closer<br/><br/>Never there<br/>You're never there<br/>You're never, ever, ever, ever there<br/><br/>Never there<br/>You're never there<br/>You're never, ever, ever, ever there
