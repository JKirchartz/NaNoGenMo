 There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do<br/>Go 'round my head<br/>The things you said<br/>Like "I love only you"<br/><br/>In my mind there's no sorrow<br/>Don't you know that it's so?<br/>There'll be no sad tomorrow<br/>Don't you know that it's so?<br/><br/>There is a place<br/>Where I can go<br/>When I feel low<br/>When I feel blue<br/>And it's my mind<br/>And there's no time<br/>When I'm alone<br/><br/>There's a place
