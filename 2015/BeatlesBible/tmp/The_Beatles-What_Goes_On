 What goes on in your heart? 
What goes on in your mind? 
You are tearing me apart 
When you treat me so unkind 
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I saw you 
As I walked along the road 
But when I saw him with you 
I could feel my future fold <br/>It's so easy for a girl like you to lie <br/>Tell me why <br/><br/>What goes on in your heart? <br/>What goes on in your mind? <br/>You are tearing me apart <br/>When you treat me so unkind <br/>What goes on in your mind?<br/><br/>I met you in the morning <br/>Waiting for the tides of time <br/>But now the tide is turning <br/>I can see that I was blind <br/>It's so easy for a girl like you to lie <br/>Tell me why (tell me why)<br/><br/>What goes on in your heart?<br/>Hey!<br/><br/>I used to think of no-one else<br/>But you were just the same <br/>You didn't even think of me <br/>As someone with a name <br/>Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?<br/>Tell me why <br/><br/>What goes on in your heart? <br/>What goes on in your mind? <br/>You are tearing me apart <br/>When you treat me so unkind <br/>What goes on in your mind?<br/><br/>(In your mind, in your mind)
