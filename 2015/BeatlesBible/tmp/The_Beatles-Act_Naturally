 They're going to put me in the movies
They're going to make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies<br/>Then I’ll know that you will plainly see<br/>The biggest fool that ever hit the big time<br/>And all I got to do is act naturally<br/><br/>We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely<br/>And begging down upon his bended knee<br/>I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing<br/>All I have to do is act naturally<br/><br/>Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star<br/>Might win an Oscar you can never tell<br/>The movie's going to make me a big star<br/>'Cause I can play the part so well<br/><br/>Well I hope you come and see me in the movies<br/>Then I’ll know that you will plainly see<br/>The biggest fool that ever hit the big time<br/>And all I got to do is act naturally
