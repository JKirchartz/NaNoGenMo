 You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl<br/>Till the end of time<br/>These days such a kind girl<br/>Seems so hard to find<br/>Someday when we're dreaming<br/>Deep in love, not a lot to say<br/>Then we will remember<br/>Things we said today<br/><br/>Me, I'm just the lucky kind<br/>Love to hear you say that love is love<br/>And though we may be blind<br/>Love is here to stay and that's enough<br/><br/>To make you mine, girl<br/>Be the only one<br/>Love me all the time, girl<br/>We'll go on and on<br/><br/>Some day when we're dreaming<br/>Deep in love not a lot to say<br/>Then we will remember<br/>Things we said today<br/><br/>Me, I'm just the lucky kind<br/>Love to hear you say that love is love<br/>And though we may be blind<br/>Love is here to stay and that's enough<br/><br/>To make you mine, girl<br/>Be the only one<br/>Love me all the time, girl<br/>We'll go on and on<br/><br/>Some day when we're dreaming<br/>Deep in love, not a lot to say<br/>Then we will remember<br/>Things we said today
