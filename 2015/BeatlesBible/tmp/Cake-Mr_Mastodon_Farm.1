You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
I can see their dead weight
Just dropping like stones
For small loaves of bread
Past my window all the time.
But unless I get up,<br/>Walk across the room<br/>And peer down below,<br/>I don't see their last second curves<br/>Toward a horizontal flight.<br/>All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones. <br/><br/>Now due to a construct in my mind<br/>That makes their falling and their flight<br/>Symbolic of my entire existence,<br/>It becomes important for me<br/>To get up and see<br/>Their last second curves toward flight.<br/>It's almost as if my life will fall<br/>Unless I see their ascent. <br/><br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Cuts swatches out of all material.<br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Cuts swatches out of all material. <br/><br/>Birds fall from the window ledge above mine.<br/>Then they flap their wings at the last second.<br/>I said birds fall from the window ledge above mine.<br/>Then they flap their wings at the last second.<br/>But unless I get up,<br/>Walk across the room<br/>And peer down below,<br/>I won't see their last second curves<br/>Toward a, a horizontal flight.<br/>All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones. <br/><br/>Now due to a construct in my mind<br/>That makes their falling and their flight<br/>Symbolic of my entire existence,<br/>It becomes important for me<br/>To get up and see<br/>Their last second curves toward flight.<br/>It's almost like my life will fall,<br/>My life will fall,<br/>Unless I see their ascent. <br/><br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Cuts swatches out of all material.<br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Mr. Mastodon farm,<br/>Cuts swatches out of all material.<br/>Mr. Mastodon Farm,<br/>Mr. Mastodon farm,<br/>Cuts swatches out of all material.
