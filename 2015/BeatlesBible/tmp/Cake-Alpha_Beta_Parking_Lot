 Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sunset- I'll never forget
Watching all the reds, and oranges slip away-
Letting go of yet, another dirty day
Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars
right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
watching the sun go down--
watching the sun go down--
watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down<br/><br/>Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot<br/>Watching you leave me- not quite believing<br/>Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot <br/>Watching the sunset- I'll never forget <br/><br/>Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars<br/>right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars<br/>watching the sun go down--<br/>watching the sun go down--<br/>watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down--<br/><br/>(guitar and trumpet break)<br/><br/>Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars<br/>Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars<br/>Watching the sun go down--<br/>Watching the sun go down--<br/>Watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down--<br/><br/>Watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down--<br/><br/>Watching    the    sun    go  down-----
