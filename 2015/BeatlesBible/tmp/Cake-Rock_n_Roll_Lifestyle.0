 Well, your CD collection
Looks shiny and costly
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?
And how much did you spend
On your black leather jacket?
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket?
Now, tickets to concerts
And drinking at clubs
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of<br/>And how much did you pay for<br/>Your rock 'n' roll T-shirt<br/>That proves you were there, that you heard of them first?<br/><br/>Now, how do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?<br/>How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?<br/>How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?<br/>Oh, tell me<br/><br/>Aw, yeah, all right<br/>All right<br/>Oh, yeah, all right, aw<br/><br/>How much did you pay<br/>For the chunk of his guitar<br/>The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?<br/>And how much will he pay<br/>For a brand-new guitar<br/>One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?<br/>And how long will the workers<br/>Keep building him new ones?<br/>As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones<br/>And how long will the workers<br/>Keep building him new ones?<br/>As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones<br/><br/>Aw, yeah, aw, yeah<br/>Aw, yeah, all right, ha<br/>Oh-ho-ho-ho<br/>Oh, no<br/><br/>Aging black leather and hospital bills<br/>And tatoo removal and dozens of pills<br/>Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments<br/>But rock on completely with some brand-new components<br/><br/>Now, how do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?<br/>How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?<br/>How do you afford your rock 'n' roll lifestyle?<br/>All right, aw, yeah<br/><br/>So good, oh, baby<br/><br/>Excess ain't rebellion<br/>You're drinkin' what they're selling now<br/>Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them<br/>Your chaos won't convert them<br/>They're so happy to rebuild it<br/>You'll never really kill it, aw, yeah<br/>Excess ain't rebellion<br/>You're drinkin' what they're selling, oh<br/>Excess ain't rebellion, oh<br/>You're drinkin', you're drinkin'<br/>Aw, yeah, you're drinkin' what they selling<br/>Aw<br/>Yeah, all right<br/>Aw<br/>Yeah<br/>All right
