 Last night I said to her
I didn't want to live inside a lie.
If she wants him
More than she wants me, Let this be.
She'll come back to me.
She'll come back to me.
She'll come back. 
All day I wait and wait<br/>To hear her footsteps on my walkway.<br/>She never came.<br/>She never even called.<br/>She'll come back to me.<br/>She'll come back to me.<br/>She'll come back. <br/><br/>Somehow I know it won't last.<br/>Somehow I know it won't last too long. <br/><br/>She'll come back to me.<br/>She'll come back to me.<br/>She'll come back to me.<br/>She'll come back to me.
