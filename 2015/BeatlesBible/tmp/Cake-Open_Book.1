 She's writing, she's writing, She's writing a novel.
She's writing, she's weaving, Conceiving a plot.
It quickens, it thickens.
You can't put it down now.
It takes you, it shakes you, It makes you lose your thought. 
But you're caught in your own glory.<br/>You are believing your own stories.<br/>Writing your own headlines.<br/>Ignoring your own deadlines.<br/>But now you've gotta write them all again. <br/><br/>You think she's an open book,<br/>But you don't know which page to turn to, do you?<br/>You think she's an open book,<br/>But you don't know which page to turn to, do you?<br/>Do you? Do you? <br/><br/>You want her, confront her.<br/>Just open your window.<br/>Unbolt it, unlock it,<br/>Unfasten your latch.<br/>You want it, confront it.<br/>Just open your window.<br/>All you really have to do is ask. <br/><br/>But you're caught in your own glory.<br/>You are believing your own stories.<br/>Timing your contractions.<br/>Inventing small contraptions<br/>That roll across your polished hardwood floors. <br/><br/>You think she's an open book,<br/>But you don't know which page to turn to, do you?<br/>You think she's an open book,<br/>But you don't know which page to turn to, do you?<br/>Do you? Do you? <br/><br/>You think she's an open book,<br/>But you don't know which page to turn to, do you?<br/>Do you? Do you? Do you?
