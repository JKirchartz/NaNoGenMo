 One day you'll look 
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know 
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come<br/>And so, my love, I must go<br/>And though I lose a friend<br/>In the end you will know, oh<br/><br/>One day you'll find <br/>That I have gone<br/>But tomorrow may rain, so<br/>I'll follow the sun<br/><br/>Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so<br/>I'll follow the sun<br/><br/>And now the time has come<br/>And so, my love, I must go<br/>And though I lose a friend<br/>In the end you will know, oh<br/><br/>One day you'll find <br/>That I have gone<br/>But tomorrow may rain, so<br/>I'll follow the sun
