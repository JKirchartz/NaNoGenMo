 I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow<br/>But I can't, so I'll cry instead<br/><br/>Don't want to cry when there's people there<br/>I get shy when they start to stare<br/>I'm gonna hide myself away<br/>But I'll come back again someday<br/><br/>And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls<br/>I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world<br/>Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two<br/>And show you what your loving man can do<br/>Until then, I'll cry instead<br/><br/>Don't want to cry when there's people there<br/>I get shy when they start to stare<br/>I'm gonna hide myself away<br/>But I'll come back again someday<br/><br/>And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls<br/>'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world<br/>Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two<br/>And show you what your loving man can do<br/>Until then, I'll cry instead
