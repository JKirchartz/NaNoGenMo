 You need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut
You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt
Come comanche, comanche, comanche, come oh
If you want to have cities, you've got to build roads
You need to find some new feathers and buy some new clothes
Just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load
Come comanche, comanche, comanche, come oh
If you want to have cities, you've got to build roads
You need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut<br/>You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt<br/>Come comanche, comanche, comanche, come oh<br/>If you want to have cities<br/>If you want to have cities<br/>If you want to have cities, you've got to build roads
