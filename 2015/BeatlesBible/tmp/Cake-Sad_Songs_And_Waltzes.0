 I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'<br/>But sad songs and waltzes  aren't selling this year<br/><br/>It's a good thing that I'm not a star<br/>You don't know how lucky you are<br/>Though my record may say it<br/>No one will play it<br/>Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year<br/><br/>It's a good thing that I'm not a star<br/>You don't know how lucky you are<br/>Though my record may say it<br/>No one will play it<br/>Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
