 There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses<br/>They tell me<br/>In sweet fragrant meadows<br/>Of dawn and dew<br/><br/>There was love all around<br/>But I never heard it singing<br/>No, I never heard it at all<br/>Till there was you<br/><br/>Then there was music and wonderful roses<br/>They tell me<br/>In sweet fragrant meadows<br/>Of dawn and dew<br/><br/>There was love all around<br/>But I never heard it singing<br/>No, I never heard it at all<br/>Till there was you<br/><br/>Till there was you
