 For I have got another girl
Another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do<br/>And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop<br/>For I have got another girl<br/><br/>Another girl who will love me till the end<br/>Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend<br/><br/>I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you<br/>But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new<br/>I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want<br/>For I have got another girl<br/><br/>Another girl who will love me till the end<br/>Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend<br/><br/>I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you<br/>But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new<br/>I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want<br/>For I have got another girl<br/>Another girl<br/><br/>Another girl
