 You don't realise how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realise
As I looked in your eyes<br/>You told me<br/><br/>Oh, yes, you told me<br/>You don't want my lovin' any more<br/>That's when it hurt me<br/>And feeling like this<br/>I just can't go on any more<br/><br/>Please remember how I feel about you<br/>I could never really live without you<br/><br/>So, come on back and see<br/>Just what you mean to me<br/>I need you<br/><br/>But when you told me<br/>You don't want my lovin' any more<br/>That's when it hurt me<br/>And feeling like this<br/>I just can't go on any more<br/><br/>Please remember how I feel about you<br/>I could never really live without you<br/><br/>So, come on back and see<br/>Just what you mean to me<br/>I need you<br/>I need you<br/><br/>I need you
