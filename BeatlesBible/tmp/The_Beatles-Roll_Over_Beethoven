 We're gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over, Beethoven
Gotta hit it again today
You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm<br/>And my soul keeps a-singing the blues<br/>Roll over, Beethoven<br/>And tell Tchaikovsky the news<br/><br/>I got a rockin' pneumonia<br/>I need a shot of rhythm and blues<br/>I think I caught it off the writer<br/>Sittin' down by the rhythm revue<br/>Roll over, Beethoven<br/>Rockin' in two by two<br/><br/>Well, if you feel it and like it<br/>Well, get your lover and reel and rock it<br/>Roll it over and move on up just<br/>Trifle further and a-reel and rock it<br/>Roll it over<br/>Roll over, Beethoven<br/>A-rockin' in two by two<br/><br/>Well, early in the mornin'<br/>I'm a givin' you the warnin'<br/>Don't you step on my blue suede shoes<br/>Hey, diddle, diddle<br/>I'm a-playin' my fiddle<br/>Ain't got nothing to lose<br/>Roll over, Beethoven<br/>And tell Tchaikovsky the news<br/><br/>You know she winks like a glow worm<br/>Dance like a spinnin' top<br/>She's got a crazy partner<br/>Oughta see him reel an' rock<br/>'S long as she got a dime<br/>The music will never stop<br/><br/>Well, roll over, Beethoven<br/>Yeah, roll over, Beethoven<br/>Roll over, Beethoven<br/>Oh, roll over, Beethoven<br/>Roll over, Beethoven<br/>Dig to these rhythm and blues
