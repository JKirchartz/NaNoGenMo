 You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again<br/>This time I will try to show that I'm<br/>Not trying to pretend<br/><br/>I thought that you would realize<br/>That if I ran away from you<br/>That you would want me, too<br/>But I got a big surprise, oh<br/><br/>You could find better things to do<br/>Than to break my heart again<br/>This time I will try to show that I'm<br/>Not trying to pretend<br/><br/>I want to go<br/>But I hate to leave you<br/>You know I hate to leave you, oh<br/><br/>You, if you break my heart, I'll go<br/>But I'll be back again
