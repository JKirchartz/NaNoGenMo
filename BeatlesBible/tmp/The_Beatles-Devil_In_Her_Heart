 She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalise
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me<br/>She's an angel sent to me<br/><br/>She's got the devil in her heart<br/>No, no, this I can't believe<br/>She's gonna tear your heart apart<br/>No, no, nay will she deceive<br/><br/>I can't believe that she'll ever ever go<br/>Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so<br/>She'll never hurt me<br/>She won't desert me<br/>Listen, can't you see?<br/><br/>She's got the devil in her heart<br/>Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe<br/>She's gonna tear your heart apart<br/>No, no, nay will she deceive<br/><br/>Don't take chances<br/>If your romance is<br/>So important to you<br/>She'll never hurt me<br/>She won't desert me<br/>She's an angel sent to me<br/><br/>She's got the devil in her heart<br/>Oh, no, no, no, no, this I can't believe<br/>She's gonna tear your heart apart<br/>No, no, nay will she deceive<br/><br/>She's got the devil in her heart<br/>No, she's an angel sent to me<br/>She's got the devil in her heart<br/>No, she's an angel sent to me
