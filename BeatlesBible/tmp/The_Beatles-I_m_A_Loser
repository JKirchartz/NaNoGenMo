 I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me<br/>I'm a loser<br/>And I'm not what I appear to be<br/><br/>Although I laugh and I act like a clown<br/>Beneath this mask, I am wearing a frown<br/>My tears are falling like rain from the sky<br/>Is it for her or myself that I cry?<br/><br/>I'm a loser<br/>And I lost someone who's near to me<br/>I'm a loser<br/>And I'm not what I appear to be<br/><br/>What have I done to deserve such a fate?<br/>I realize I have left it too late<br/>And so it's true, pride comes before a fall<br/>I'm telling you so that you won't lose all<br/><br/>I'm a loser<br/>And I lost someone who's near to me<br/>I'm a loser<br/>And I'm not what I appear to be
