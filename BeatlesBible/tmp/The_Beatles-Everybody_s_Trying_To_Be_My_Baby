 Well, they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby, now<br/><br/>Went out last night, I didn't stay late<br/>'Fore I got home I had a-nineteen dates<br/><br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby, now<br/><br/>Went out last night, I didn't stay late<br/>'Fore I got home I had a-nineteen dates<br/><br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby, now<br/><br/>Well, they took some honey from a tree<br/>Dressed it up and they called it me<br/><br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby<br/>Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
