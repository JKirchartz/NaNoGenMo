 Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true<br/>And then while I'm away<br/>I'll write home every day<br/>And I'll send all my loving to you<br/><br/>All my loving<br/>I will send to you<br/>All my loving<br/>Darling, I'll be true<br/><br/>Close your eyes and I'll kiss you<br/>Tomorrow I'll miss you<br/>Remember I'll always be true<br/>And then while I'm away<br/>I'll write home every day<br/>And I'll send all my loving to you<br/><br/>All my loving<br/>I will send to you<br/>All my loving<br/>Darling, I'll be true<br/><br/>All my loving<br/>All my loving, ooh<br/>All my loving<br/>I will send to you
