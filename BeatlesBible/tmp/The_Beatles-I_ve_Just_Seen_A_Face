 I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Falling, yes, I am fallin'<br/>And she keeps callin'<br/>Me back again<br/><br/>I have never known the like of this<br/>I've been alone and I have missed things<br/>And kept out of sight<br/>But other girls were never quite like this<br/><br/>Falling, yes, I am fallin'<br/>And she keeps callin'<br/>Me back again<br/><br/>Fallin', yes, I am fallin'<br/>And she keeps callin'<br/>Me back again<br/><br/>I've just seen a face<br/>I can't forget the time or place where we just met<br/>She's just the girl for me<br/>And I want all the world to see we've met<br/><br/>Fallin', yes, I am fallin'<br/>And she keeps callin'<br/>Me back again<br/><br/>Fallin', yes, I am fallin'<br/>And she keeps callin'<br/>Me back again<br/><br/>Oh, fallin', yes, I am fallin'<br/>And she keeps callin'<br/>Me back again
