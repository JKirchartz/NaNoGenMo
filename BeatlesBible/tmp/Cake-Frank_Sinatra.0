 We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
While Frank Sinatra sings "Stormy Weather"
The flies and spiders get along together
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record
Beyond the suns that guard this roost
Beyond your flowers of flaming truth
Beyond your latest ad campaigns<br/><br/>An old man sits, collecting stamps<br/>In a room all filled with Chinese lamps<br/>He saves what others throw away<br/>He says that he'll be rich someday<br/><br/>We know of an ancient radiation<br/>That haunts dismembered constellations<br/>A faintly glimmering radio station<br/><br/>We know of an ancient radiation<br/>That haunts dismembered constellations<br/>A faintly glimmering radio station<br/><br/>While Frank Sinatra sings "Stormy Weather"<br/>The flies and spiders get along together<br/>Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record
