 I've got wheels of polished steel
I've got tires that grab the road
I've got seats that selflessly hold my friends
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads
I've got a mind that can steer me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor<br/>(satan is my motor)<br/>Hear my motor purr<br/>Satan is my motor, motor<br/>Hear my motor purr<br/>Satan is the only one who seems to understand<br/><br/>I've got brakes I'm wide awake<br/>I can stop this car at any time<br/>At the very last second I can change direction<br/>Turn completely around if I feel so inclined<br/><br/>I've got a mind that can steer me to your house<br/>And a heart that can bring you red flowers<br/>My intentions are good and earnest and true<br/>But under my hood is internal combustion power<br/><br/>And Satan is my motor<br/>(satan is my motor)<br/>Hear my motor purr<br/>Satan is my motor<br/>Hear my motor purr<br/>Satan is the only one who seems to understand<br/>Satan is my motor<br/>Satan is the only one who seems to understand
