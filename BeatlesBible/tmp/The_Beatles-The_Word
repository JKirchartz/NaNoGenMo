 Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
In the beginning I misunderstood 
But now I've got it
The word is good<br/><br/>Spread the word and you'll be free <br/>Spread the word and be like me<br/>Spread the word I'm thinking of<br/>Have you heard the word is love? <br/>It's so fine, it's sunshine<br/>It's the word, love <br/>Everywhere I go I hear it said<br/>In the good and the bad books that I have read<br/><br/>Say the word and you'll be free <br/>Say the word and be like me <br/>Say the word I'm thinking of <br/>Have you heard the word is love? <br/>It's so fine, it's sunshine<br/>It's the word, love <br/>Now that I know what I feel must be right <br/>I'm here to show everybody the light <br/><br/>Give the word a chance to say <br/>That the word is just the way <br/>It's the word I'm thinking of <br/>And the only word is love <br/>It's so fine, it's sunshine<br/>It's the word, love<br/><br/>Say the word, love<br/>Say the word, love<br/>Say the word, love<br/>Say the word<br/>Love
