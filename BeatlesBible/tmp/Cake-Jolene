Like she'd done one hundred times before
Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror
She folded the towel carefully and put it back in place
Yeah I want to pull you down into bed
I want to cast your face in lead
Oh, yeah
All right, now
Well every time I pull you close<br/>Push my face into your hair<br/>Cream rinse and tobacco smoke<br/>That sickly scent is always, always there<br/><br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah <br/><br/>Jolene heard her father's uneven snores<br/>Right then she knew there must be something more<br/>Jolene heard the singing in the forest<br/>She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night<br/><br/>Yeah I want to throw you out into space<br/>I want to do whatever it takes, takes, takes<br/><br/>Well every time I pull you close<br/>Push my face into your hair<br/>Cream rinse and tobacco smoke<br/>That sickly scent is always, always there<br/><br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah yeah<br/>Yeah, oh guitar
