 Walk on by 
The house where you still live
Walk on by 
The place where we would kiss
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight, I must walk on by
Walk on by 
The room where you still sleep
Walk on by <br/>The company that you keep<br/>And the room where I held you tight <br/>Tonight, I must walk on by<br/><br/>Somehow i know<br/>I won't forget you no no no no no, i won't<br/>You won't forget me no no no no no, you won't<br/>I'll keep on walking away from here<br/>I'll forget you when I reach the other side<br/><br/>Walk on by the house where you still live<br/>Walk on by the place where we would kiss<br/>And the room where I held you tight<br/>Tonight, I must walk on by<br/><br/>And the room where I held you tight <br/>Tonight, I must walk on by
