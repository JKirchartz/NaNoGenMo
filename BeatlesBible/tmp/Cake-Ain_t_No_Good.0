 She's gonna hand you a red-headed Gabriel
Coming from the bar in a plastic tie
He's gonna swing from the tree of life
He's gonna try and sell you on a great big lie
But when you speak to her, her eyes light up
The music spills right into your cup
The minstrels play and the waitress brings ice
There are pies on a carousel, have a slice
But watch out, she ain't no good for you<br/><br/>He's gonna spin like the tractor pull<br/>She'll sit back when he tells his tale<br/>He's gonna yell when he drinks his beer,<br/>She'll sit back and drink ginger ale<br/><br/>But when you speak to her, her eyes light up<br/>The music spills right into your cup<br/>It's so abrupt and it's so concise<br/>There are pies on a carousel, have a slice<br/>But watch out, she ain't no good for you, I say<br/>Watch out, she ain't no good for you<br/><br/>She'd like to put you in her zoo<br/>Right between the canaries and the cockatoos<br/>She'll pull out your feathers for her brand new hat<br/>And when she's done that, she'll feed you to her cat<br/>So watch out, she ain't no good for you<br/>Watch out, she ain't no good for you<br/>Watch out, she ain't no good for you
