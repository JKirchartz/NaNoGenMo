 A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine
Doo doo n'doo
Doo doo n'doo
I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again<br/><br/>A taste of honey (A taste of honey)<br/>Tasting much sweeter<br/>Than wine<br/><br/>Oh, I will return<br/>Yes, I will return<br/>I'll come back<br/>For the honey and you<br/><br/>Yours was the kiss<br/>That awoke my heart<br/>There lingers still<br/>Though we're far apart<br/><br/>That taste of honey<br/>(A taste of honey)<br/>Tasting much sweeter<br/>Than wine<br/><br/>Oh, I will return<br/>Yes, I will return<br/>I'll come back (He'll come back)<br/>For the honey (For the honey)<br/>And you
