A city is not gauged by its length and width, but by the broadness of its vision and the height of its dreams.
Actors endow the villain in fiction with a warmth and quality that makes them memorable. I think we like fictional villains because they're the Mr. Hyde of our own dreams. I've met a few real villains in my time, and they weren't the least bit sympathetic.

Becoming a part of the Marvel Universe was my childhood dream. Like most kids growing up, I read a lot of comic books and acted out some of the characters with friends.

I am a dreamer. Seriously, I'm living on another planet.
I am a firm believe in the power of dreams, because the world is basically one giant realization of people's collective dreams come true.

I believe history will come to view 9/11 as an event on par with November 22, 1963, the date on which John F. Kennedy was murdered, cutting short a presidency that was growing ever more promising. Dreams died that day in Dallas; it is easy to imagine the 1960s turning out rather differently had President Kennedy lived.
I believe in everything until it's disproved. So I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons. It all exists, even if it's in your mind. Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now?
I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.

I couldn't find the sports car of my dreams, so I built it myself.
I couldn't help but to think back to my classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio.

The difference was opportunity.
I'd definitely be the kind of parent who enabled my child's dreams. I'd just watch and nurture and guide them. I have the blueprints of what not to do... I think I'd be a good parent, actually.
I defected to South Korea in search of freedom of speech and movement. I had longed to put my feet on this soil, even in my dreams.
Ideologies separate us. Dreams and anguish bring us together.
I did not move to New York with a plan. The first time I moved to New York, I just popped up. My sister was living here in New York. I just popped up. She had her baby and a husband, and I just popped up. 'Hey, what's up? I got $200 and dreams. Let's do this.'
I do not have bad days. I don't wake up in the morning and think that I'm going to get AIDS. I don't dream bad dreams about it. If I did, I'd be giving in to the negativity.
I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.
I don't like dreams or reality. I like when dreams become reality because that is my life.

I don't mind an arranged marriage. The girl my parents choose could be the girl of my dreams.
I don't read good books anymore, it seems; I just buy them and put them on the shelf and every now and then walk over and pet them. I'm like the optimistic dieter who fills her closet with clothes two sizes too small and dreams of the day she can wear them. I know just what I want to do when I retire.
I don't really think dreams have real meaning. Some people believe in that. I just think it's your brain, after a day of crazy random pieces of information jumbled together, creating interesting stories. I just view it as entertainment.
I don't remember my dreams too much. I hardly have ever gotten ideas from nighttime dreams. But I love daydreaming and dream logic and the way dreams go.
I don't stand in anybody else's way of accomplishing their dreams, and I don't like people standing in my way, either. That seems like a hostile thing to do.
I don't think I'm the face of the city or the Houston Astros. I'm just another guy who is playing hard to make dreams come true.
I don't think you should spend your life praying for things, but I do believe you should thank God for what He's given you... but I think the scripture teaches us that we can pray for our dreams, pray for the big things... he's not a small God; this God is incredible.
I don't understand people who dream in black and white. I just don't get it. My dreams have always been vivid color.
I don't use drugs, my dreams are frightening enough.
I don't want to give people the wrong advice to follow their dreams no matter what, because it's not fun to be a starving artist. But on the other hand, life is short, and if you are burning with a passion to do something, then do it. Work hard, study hard at it, and don't give up.
I dream a lot, in colour and in sound and scent. Quite a few of my stories have come from dreams.

I dream of painting and then I paint my dream.
I dream that someday the step between my mind and my finger will no longer be needed. And that simply by blinking my eyes, I shall make pictures. Then, I think, I shall really have become a photographer.
I'd say it's been my biggest problem all my life... it's money. It takes a lot of money to make these dreams come true.
I envy people with dreams and passions, but I don't think that way. I still don't have a 'bliss' to follow. For people like me - I suspect that's most people - holding out for a 'dream' or a 'passion' is paralyzing. I just like having work I enjoy that feels meaningful. That's hard enough... but it's enough.
If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts.

I feel like, big city or small town, you can relate to following your parents' footsteps or putting your own dreams on the back burner or vices that we get caught up in - that whole cycle. That's not just a small-town thing. That's a life thing.
I feel like dreams are always a little tricky, you know? But if you just push through the struggles and the hard times, it'll be so worth it in the end because you will be able to get to your dreams.
I feel like I'm making a difference. I feel like putting out a message for young girls to follow your dreams and just work at what you want to do and be yourself.
I felt like an ugly duckling back in school. I was a complete tomboy with short hair. Never in my dreams did I imagine that I would walk the ramp with 6-inch heels. My friends can't believe that I'm an actor, because I was such an introvert in school.
If I sleep for more than half an hour, I get horrible dreams in which I'm firing a gun and helicopters are coming down.

If you're the type of person who has to fulfill your dreams, you've gotta be resourceful to make sure you can do it. I came out to California when I was 21, thinking my New York credentials would take me all the way. I came back home a year later all dejected and a failure.
If you're too scared to put your dreams, thoughts, desires, fantasies on paper and share them with the world, then being an author isn't the right career for you.
If your mom asks you to do the dishes, do not pull out your pirate attitude. But if someone tells you you're not good enough, says your dreams are too lofty, or claims there is no room in showbiz for a dancing violinist - well then, by all means, pull out your eye patch, my friend, and take to the high seas.
If you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams.
If you want to achieve your dreams, you must follow them, and the best way to follow them is not to think about wanting to be very rich, but to think about doing something that you really want to do.
If you want to have a life that is worth living, a life that expresses your deepest feelings and emotions and cares and dreams, you have to fight for it.

I have accomplished my childhood dream: to be in show business. Everybody should be so lucky to have their dreams come true. I've been truly blessed.
I have a long way to go as far as my acting career is concerned. Lots of milestones are to be achieved and dreams to be fulfilled. I would someday want to do playback singing, too, as I am a very passionate singer.
I have always been amazed at the way an ordinary observer lends so much more credence and attaches so much more importance to waking events than to those occurring in dreams... Man... is above all the plaything of his memory.

I have dreams of becoming a professional pastry chef and having a little bakery - that's how much I love baking. I love to cook in general, but my heart lies in desserts.
I have four sisters at home, and both my mom and dad worked, and both of them took care of us. It wasn't like my mom was fully domestic, or my dad was fully domestic: they were just equals in their relationship.

I have mixed feelings about how fast things are changing as a result of technology. There's no denying that through technology there are amazing things being created that help people with diseases or help people's dreams come true. But there's also this obsession. Social media is the most dangerous of them all.

I hear from all different people, not just people like me, or lesbians. It be straight people, it be grown men, it be grown women, people that have been sick or depressed that say, 'Oh, you made me want to go do what I want to do for myself and chase my dreams.' That's my purpose.
I hope I can help inspire people to go for their dreams.

I know it sounds corny, but when you follow your dreams, it happens. And if it's music, take it seriously.

I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.

I never paint dreams or nightmares. I paint my own reality.
I never take for granted how lucky I am to be an American and what a privilege it is to spend each day at a nonprofit dedicated to helping the next generation of girls achieve their dreams.

In high school, I worked eight hours a day just so I could get into the college of my dreams and say that I got in - and I never went.
In Kenya, I met wonderful girls; girls who wanted to help their communities. I was with them in their school, listening to their dreams. They still have hope. They want to be doctor and teachers and engineers.
In my dreams and visions, I seemed to see a line, and on the other side of that line were green fields, and lovely flowers, and beautiful white ladies, who stretched out their arms to me over the line, but I couldn't reach them no-how. I always fell before I got to the line.
In my dreams I am not crippled. In my dreams, I dance.

In my dreams, I have Keira Knightley's eyebrows.
In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield.

In my long life I have found peace, joy, and happiness beyond my fondest hopes and dreams. One of the supreme benedictions of my life has been my marriage to an elect daughter of God. I love her with all my heart and soul.

In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.
Inspiration comes from so many sources. Music, other fiction, the non-fiction I read, TV shows, films, news reports, people I know, stories I hear, misheard words or lyrics, dreams... Motivation? The memory of the rush I get from a really good writing session - even on a bad day, I know I'll find that again if I keep going.
In the big picture, few of our careers live up to the dreams we nursed when we were young. In fact, one underside of success is that it's nearly always penultimate, and so every accomplishment merely raises the bar.
In the books I have written, I have created in my mind a universe. My kids say I have a village in my head and I live in that village, and it's true. When I start writing a book, characters from previous books reappear. All my emotions, my mind, my heart, my dreams, everything becomes connected with a new book, and nothing else really matters.
I only remember the end of my dreams, like waking up at a steering wheel, or falling.
I paint what cannot be photographed, that which comes from the imagination or from dreams, or from an unconscious drive.
I part of this great nation because my grandfather was born here, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He took a horse, back in 1895, and ride it all the way down to Guanajuato, looking for his American dream.

I prefer to be a dreamer among the humblest, with visions to be realized, than lord among those without dreams and desires.
I realized that, when you're 18, your world is wide open. But as each year passes, one more nail goes into the coffin, killing you dreams and aspirations. And by the time you reach 25, you've been beaten down and become a realist. And my advice is you can't let these things get you down.
I really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid, and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot.
I really think you can manifest your dreams. You can manifest your destiny. If you want something hard enough and you're willing to work for it, I think you can get it. I truly believe that.
I remember being a young boy in Poland, watching David Seaman, Thierry Henry, Dennis Berkamp and others play for Arsenal. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would get a chance to play for the club I supported as a little kid.
I say to my colleagues never confine your best work, your hopes, your dreams, the aspiration of the American people to what will be signed by George W. Bush because that is too limiting a factor.
I sleep around 8 hours, but I tend to wake up several times a night with constant dreams, thoughts, and ideas related to Rent the Runway.
I spend a lot of time thinking about this business of letting go - letting go of the children God gives to us for such a brief time before they go off on their own; letting go of old homes, old friends, old places and old dreams.
I stand for freedom of expression, doing what you believe in, and going after your dreams.
I stayed true to my dreams and, eventually, they came true.
I still have dreams about CBGB's. I still miss the place.
I still have dreams in which someone is coming to the door.
I still marvel at how God turns dreams into reality.

It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.
I tell kids to pursue their basketball dreams, but I tell them to not let that be their only dream.
I tell people 'America's Got Talent' is the best summer job you could have - you get to watch people strive for their dreams all summer long. So when you see me rooting for these people or dancing on the side of the stage, that's what I'd be doing if I was watching this show at home!
I tell people I'm too stupid to know what's impossible. I have ridiculously large dreams, and half the time they come true.
It has been my observation that parents kill more dreams than anybody.
It has never been my object to record my dreams, just the determination to realize them.
I think a lot of my dreams have come true, and my next dream is to have a No. 1 selling album. A Grammy-award-winning album.
I think, as a child, there weren't dreams. I can't recall as a child having some ultimate dream and thinking that it was possible.
I think being nice and being safe is unfair to yourself when you have big dreams as a woman. I think you have to prepare yourself that not everyone in this world has the same personality... The one thing I've chosen to be great at in my life is singing - so why not be proud that I'm great at it?
I think everyone dreams of that nice romantic wedding.
I think everyone has dreams, and it's just how you go about pursuing that. And I think anybody can do anything that they set their mind to. So if you set your mind to do something, and you exhaust every opportunity, I think you're going to get there.
I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name.
I think it's less stressful to just make decisions as you go, because plans never work out, but you never run out of dreams. You have an eternal bucket list where you keep crossing things off, and keep adding things to the bottom.
I think I usually have quite ordinary dreams. Sometimes my dreams take me to other dimensions. I can travel in my mind especially when I'm dreaming I focus my mind on what I want to dream. If I want to fly, I focus on flying.
I think of myself as a catalyst of action and a messenger of hope, turning people onto themselves and turning people onto their dreams.
I think people tend to see the bigger point, which is maybe not fitting in and feeling like you didn't have the childhood that you expected you would have, or that you felt lonely or struggled with drugs and alcohol or just that you were able to achieve your dreams.

I think the biggest advice that I could give people is to actually try and live beyond your dreams by pushing yourself, challenging yourself to do things a little bit outside of your comfort zone.
I think there are a number of things that you can do to encourage your kids' dreams, but I do believe in speaking by experience of having a lot of help along the way, stumbling in the past. We've all stumbled, and we certainly all deserve to get up and walk again.
I think there must be a place inside of us where dreams go and wait their turn.
I think there's a time as a writer when you want to see the best things in life, and you go out wherever you go with your dreams as a writer or a composer.
I think us women need to appreciate ourselves, and I think we need to really go after our dreams. Us Latinas tend to sacrifice too much for our husbands, our families, and our kids. We sometimes give up on our dreams in order to help the ones we love. I think it's important to feel accomplished and achieve the goals that we set for ourselves.
I think we dream so we don't have to be apart so long. If we're in each other's dreams, we can play together all night.
I think what every skater dreams of is not only skating the best program they can possibly skate, but, y'know, having the crowd roar at the end, and it was just so loud I couldn't even hear my music.
I think when you move past your fear and you go after your dreams wholeheartedly, you become free.
I think when you move past your fear and you go after your dreams wholeheartedly, you become free. Know what I'm saying? Move past the fear.
It is a lot easier to stay focused and keep your head above water when you are pursuing your ultimate dreams!
It is an everlasting desire to make my dreams come true. And it's getting to the point now where it's like, come on I want my dreams to come true so that I can get on with the rest of my life. Sometimes I think about the rest of my life when I'm done.
It is better to risk starving to death then surrender. If you give up on your dreams, what's left?
It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world. It is great good health to want to understand one's dreams. It is great good health to desire the ambiguous and paradoxical.
It is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.
It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.
It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream.
It is one of the blessings of this world that few people see visions and dream dreams.
It's absolutely clear to me that Obama has enormous intrapersonal intelligence. His book, 'Dreams from My Father,' is an amazing book, and it's obvious to everybody he has lots of intrapersonal intelligence.

It's good to have plans and dreams, but don't be surprised if God brings you somewhere else.
It's great to see our players get some of their dreams come true.
It's hard because people always say, 'Follow your dreams,' but it's not a perfect world, and things don't always work out. But you've just got to work hard, and you can't take things for granted.
It's important to believe in yourself and the beauty of your dreams and to not let anyone tell you different.
It's insecurity that is always chasing you and standing in the way of your dreams.
It's not my job to dream your dreams. It's my job to make your dreams become a reality.
It's surreal to know my dreams are coming true.
It's when children are 15, 16 or 17 that they decide whether they want to be a doctor, an engineer, a politician or go to the Mars or moon. That is the time they start having a dream, and that's the time you can work on them. You can help them shape their dreams.
It takes a lot of courage to show your dreams to someone else.
It takes someone with a vision of the possibilities to attain new levels of experience. Someone with the courage to live his dreams.
It was Delhi that gave me the platform to achieve my dreams.
It wasn't easy to leave my comfort zone and chase my dreams. However, it is important to believe in yourself.
It was one of my dreams as a child, growing up in my little village with my cousins. We used to walk together, and I used to say, when you look at the world map, 'This town is there, that town is there, that river is there.' I used to say, 'One day, I'm going to travel these places.'
I understand it's my role to realize people's dreams.
I used to work at a movie theater and sold hams at Honey Baked Ham during the holidays. I sold a ton of hams, and they offered me a regular job there, which I turned down. I feel like anything you do, just do it 100% because then that work ethic will bleed through when it's time to work on your dreams.
I've always been a champion of kids pursuing their dreams. But sometimes in life, extraordinary circumstances may force us to temporarily put our dreams on hold. The most important thing is to never lose sight of that dream, no matter what punches life may throw in our way.
I've always been interested in photographing traditions and customs - especially in America. The prom is an American tradition, a rite of passage that has always been one of the most important rituals of American youth. It is a day in our lives that we never forget - a day full of hopes and dreams for our future.
I've always followed my heart and pursued my dreams, and I imagine that people find that inspiring. I hope that is the effect I have on my fans and people in general. I definitely want to project a positive energy out into the world.
I've always said that one night, I'm going to find myself in some field somewhere, I'm standing on grass, and it's raining, and I'm with the person I love, and I know I'm at the very point I've been dreaming of getting to.
I've dreamed landscapes for years, and my dreams play an enormous role in my work. In fact, when I first started doing landscapes I felt insecure about painting in this style, and the dreams were like positive omens for me, and I've done a few paintings that were exact replicas of images that came to me in dreams.
I've got a lot of dreams I want to achieve, and I hope someone can cheer me on as I'll cheer them on in their dreams.
I've got big, big dreams for the future.
I've had quite a lot of luck with dreams. I've often awoken in the night with a phrase or even a whole song in my head.
I've lived out many of the dreams I had as a little girl, back when I was riding my pony, mucking stalls, feeding cows, aspiring to finally become a professional jockey and racing in stakes races on a worldwide stage.
I've never been bashful to say that I'm not really interested in Formula One. When I lived in England, it's all I wanted to do and I thought that anything else would somehow be a compromise to my dreams. But then when I came back to the States, I realised how much I loved being back in the States.
I've said it before, but it's absolutely true: My mother gave me my drive, but my father gave me my dreams. Thanks to him, I could see a future.
I've shown that if you dream and are willing to work hard, you can achieve your dreams.
I've succeeded beyond my wildest dreams - financially and the amount of fun I have in my life.
I've woken up from dreams and the whole song is there. I'm listening to it in my dreams. I consciously have to wake myself up and get a tape recorder because I hear it like a record.
I wanted to be a musician. I wanted to be a superstar. I wanted to be on stage. I wanted to perform. I wanted to be in movies. But as you grow up, those dreams kind of fade away, and you're hit with reality, and you're like, 'Oh, not everyone can be Lil' Bow Wow?' Fine.
I want my boys to have an understanding of people's emotions, their insecurities, people's distress, and their hopes and dreams.
I want people to follow their dreams, yes... but I'm not interested in telling young black kids how to be rappers... I want to show them that there's so many other paths you can take, besides a rapper or basketball player.
I want people to see that I'm just a girl who went for her dreams.
I want people to see that you don't need to rely on other people to make your dreams happen: you have to grab them yourself.
I want that longevity in the career, so if you don't know how to get it, you trying to chase that high, you trying to continue to chase your dreams and conquer things you never thought you could get. And you just want to get there too soon, so you taking the wrong moves to try and compensate what's not happening.
I want to be a role model. I want to be able to know that I inspired girls to work hard and go for their dreams and to never give up.
I want to find someone who's really into something like I'm really into something, so that I can support them and we can both cheer each other on. I've got a lot of dreams I want to achieve, and I hope someone can cheer me on as I'll cheer them on in their dreams.
I want to help children in Serbia and around the world so they can realize their dreams.
I want to keep my dreams, even bad ones, because without them, I might have nothing all night long.

I was a great dreamer of day dreams.
I was always a dreamer, in childhood especially. People thought I was a little strange.

I was an electrician, and now I'm in 'Electric Dreams.' It's almost bizarre.
I was born in Paris in the mid-1960s, and by the time I was 12 I had started going to the movies by myself. Most of the movies of that period never appealed to me. I didn't like the 'naturalism,' the sad or the 'down-to-earth' characters. What I wanted from film was fantasy, dreams, funny situations, extravagant decor - and beautiful women.
I was fortunate to come from a family that supported my dreams.
I was in Nepal and I had watched Oprah Winfrey's show. I had no idea, as a kid in Nepal, who she was, but I remember watching an episode of hers about living your dreams.
I was in school to play basketball; I wasn't trying to be a doctor. It's hard to talk about the NCAA rules and everything that happened in the past because I've just been focused on practicing and getting ready... I was trying to reach my dreams, and that's to play in the NBA.
I was inspired to shoot 'Look Back at It' in a high school because I'm like a voice of the youth. When the youth sees me in a classroom, I want them to be inspired to accomplish their dreams. I was just like them in a classroom at one point. It all starts in a classroom.
I was never once told to consider anything but my dreams. It's probably one of the greatest gifts my parents gave me, because it never occurred to me to do something other than what I loved.
I was satisfied with having a couple of fights a year, to enjoy them and have them be part of my training routine. When the UFC came around, it seemed like it fell in my lap. It was like I got so good at my hobby, and now I'm living all these people's dreams who had been working for so many years.
I was so lucky to have parents who supported me, 100%, with whatever I was doing, both financially and emotionally. Having that they made my life so much easier. Instead of becoming a bartender and trying to survive while trying to pursue your dreams, I didn't have to worry about that aspect. I could just pursue my dreams.
I was told before my first trip that no city in the world offered the dreams you could have sleeping in Havana. But nobody warned me that Havana also always feels like an exhausting nightmare that never quite fulfills the promise of what it's threatening you with.
I went to stand-up when my rock n' roll dreams weren't coming true. I knew it wasn't going to happen when I was in a New Wave band in 1992 - at the height of grunge. Then I heard No Doubt's 'Spiderwebs' and I said, 'Well, we're done.' They did - and succeeded at - what we were trying to do.
I will say that if my wildest dreams come true, I will, like, wake up one day, and I will be Carol Dweck, right? Because she is like everything I want to be.
I worked at the golf course, and I always had dreams and aspirations of being a professional golfer.
I would encourage you to set really high goals. Set goals that, when you set them, you think they're impossible. But then every day you can work towards them, and anything is possible, so keep working hard and follow your dreams.
I would honestly say that with all the awards and all the other things that I've done in my life, Dollywood is one of the greatest dreams that I've ever had come true - I am so proud of that I can't even begin to tell you, Dollywood is real special to me.
I would like to see anyone be able to achieve their dreams, and that's what this organization does.
I would love to spend all my time writing to you; I'd love to share with you all that goes through my mind, all that weighs on my heart, all that gives air to my soul; phantoms of art, dreams that would be so beautiful if they could come true.
I would say don't take advice from people like me who have gotten very lucky. We're very biased. You know, like Taylor Swift telling you to follow your dreams is like a lottery winner telling you, 'Liquidize your assets; buy Powerball tickets - it works!'
Jazz to me is a living music. It's a music that since its beginning has expressed the feelings, the dreams, hopes, of the people.
Job training empowers people to realize their dreams and improve their lives.
Judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams.
Just follow your dreams and be patient.

Keep God first, chase your dreams, and everything will pay off.
Keep true to the dreams of your youth.
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.
Kids need a happy household. They need to be loved and supported in their dreams. And I don't think you can make your kids' dreams your own. They need you to support them in their dreams.

Life without dreams is like a bird with a broken wing - it can't fly.
Like all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truth.
Like anyone, I like having goals to work towards. That said, I've also learned that you have to start with baby steps to reach your dreams, whether big or small.
Like dreams, statistics are a form of wish fulfillment.
Like my mother, I was always saying, 'I'll fix my life one day.' It became clear when I saw her die without fulfilling her dreams that my time was now or maybe never.
Like the phoenix, socialism is reborn from every pile of ashes left day in, day out, by burnt-out human dreams and charred hopes.
Listen to the sounds of nature. Wishing you the best on your trek towards your dreams.
Literature for me isn't a workaday job, but something which involves desires, dreams and fantasy.
Living in dreams of yesterday, we find ourselves still dreaming of impossible future conquests.
Lonesome. Lonesome. I know what it means. Here all by my lonesome, dreaming empty dreams. Weary. Weary at the close of day, wondering if tomorrow brings me joy or sorrow.
Long walks on the beach are the supposed holy grail of a romantic evening. The beach becomes a kind of utopia - the place where all our dreams come true.
Look for the light. Look for it in everything. Look for it in yourself, in your children, in your job, and in your dreams. Look for it in the food you eat and in the people you surround yourself with.
Lose your dreams and you might lose your mind.
Love is the most terrible, and also the most generous of the passions; it is the only one which includes in its dreams the happiness of someone else.
Make treating yourself a priority and always remember your life is happening now. Don't put off all your dreams and pleasures to another day. In any balanced personal definition of success there has to be a powerful element of living life in the present.
Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality; man, alone, can dream and make his dreams come true.
Man is a genius when he is dreaming.
Married or unmarried, young or old, poet or worker, you are still a dreamer, and will one time know, and feel, that your life is but a dream.
Memories have huge staying power, but like dreams, they thrive in the dark, surviving for decades in the deep waters of our minds like shipwrecks on the sea bed.
Men are the dreams of a shadow.
Men don't come up to you to just talk. We come up to you with a plan. We're looking across the room at you, and we don't care about your hopes and dreams. We don't care about what your future holds. We saw something we wanted.
More dreams are realised and extinguished in Bombay than any other place in India.
Most new jobs won't come from our biggest employers. They will come from our smallest. We've got to do everything we can to make entrepreneurial dreams a reality.
Most of us accept that although we may believe our dreams to be real events, upon waking, we can tell the difference between nocturnal hallucinations and reality.
Mother believed that I should have an enormous amount of sleep, and so I was never really tired when I went to bed. This was the best time of day, when I could lie in the vague twilight, drifting off to sleep, making up dreams inside my head the way they should go.
Mothers have always held such symbolic weight in determining a person's worth. Your mother tongue, your motherland, your mother's values - these things can qualify or disqualify you from attaining myriad American dreams: love, fluency, citizenship, legitimacy, acceptance, success, freedom.
Movies are dreams! And they work on you subliminally.
Mr. Miyazaki's specialty is taking a primal wish of kids, transporting them to a fantasyland, and then marooning them there. No one else conjures the phantasmagoric and shifting morality of dreams - that fascinating and frightening aspect of having something that seems to represent good become evil - in the way this master Japanese animator does.
Mr. Tennyson has said that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, but he wisely refrains from saying whether they are good or bad things.
Much as there are things about our own life stories that we can learn only from the systematic study of our dreams, there are things about the human condition that we can learn only from a systematic study of literature.
Much can be inferred about a man from his mistress: in her one beholds his weaknesses and his dreams.
Mum and Dad had waited 16 years for adoption laws to change in their home state, Tasmania, so that they could apply to the authorities to create the family of their dreams.

Music inspires contemplation, dreams, and the imagination.

My dreams are bigger than money; they're bigger than fame.
My dreams are of water. And my nightmares.
My dreams do not end with playing Major League Baseball.

My dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed - my dearest pleasure when free.
My dreams were always small and puny. All I ever needed was a little house with a little picket fence by the sea. Little did I know that I would live in Malacanang Palace for 20 years and visit all the major palaces of mankind. And then also meet ordinary citizens and the leaders of superpowers.
My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings.
My experience of malaria was just taking anti-malarials, which give you strange dreams, because I don't want to get malaria.
My family doesn't understand trying to chase your dreams because they were all about survival.
My father, his spirit is with me constantly, and I'm a believer in that world and the world of dreams and that stuff.
My father is a very successful man in the corporate world, and I am his only son. He had certain dreams for me. I was scared to tell him that I wanted to be an actor.
My fear is that I go up to the girl of my dreams and say 'I'm sorry, but I've got to say hello to you,' and she slides the stool back and gets up and walks away, saying, 'Not for me, Bub. I don't want anything to do with you.'
My first tattoo is a French proverb, and it says, 'Dream your life, live your dreams.'

My heroes, my dreams, and my future lay in Yankee Stadium. And they can't take that away from me.
My imagination completely controls me, and forever feeds the fire that burns with dark red light in my heart by bringing me the best dreams. I've always had a wild imagination, a big heart and a tortured soul so I feel that dark fantasy, love and horror are in my blood.
My life turned out to be beyond my greatest dreams.
My mom said it's always positive vibes. I love good vibes, and that's what I get off people all of the time. That's what I want to give out to other people is those vibes and to have hope and dreams and to build that confidence and be encouraged to do whatever they want in life if they put their mind to it.
My mom taught me to go after my dreams. I have this faith in myself that I must have gotten from her.
My mom, whether it's right or wrong, she had dreams for me to have a certain life. It takes time to get used to that. But they've been really supportive, and they love me for exactly who I am.
My mother always gives the best advice. When I left Puerto Rico to pursue my dreams, she always supported me and said to me, 'I'm never going to cut your wings, so don't let anyone else do that to you.' That has been my philosophy through life. I want to share that valuable lesson with my little girl someday.
My mother gave me the discipline to follow my dreams. You know: you can do what you want as long as you put your back into it. Just keep ploughing away.
My mother is my biggest role model, and she showed me how to do it right. She was very present in our lives and has a great career of her own. Same with my father. So I knew it was possible going in to stay closely connected to my children while also chasing big dreams. And it's given me great perspective.

My pictures are always part of my thinking, and my emotions, tensions, dreams, desires.
My story, I feel like it's amazing, because it shows people no matter where you come from, no matter what your lifestyle is, your dreams could still come true if you believe in yourself and push hard to do what you want to do.
My theory is that literature is essential to society in the way that dreams are essential to our lives. We can't live without dreaming - as we can't live without sleep. We are 'conscious' beings for only a limited period of time, then we sink back into sleep - the 'unconscious.' It is nourishing, in ways we can't fully understand.
Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths.
Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than the one with all the facts.
Never in my wildest dreams did I entertain the idea that I would become a fashion designer.

Never think you can't do something. I definitely never thought I could write a book, and even after I started writing it, I was like, 'Oh my God, how am I gonna write a book?' Just set your sights high and reach for the stars. Go live your dreams, and never think you can't.
Never underestimate the power of dreams and the influence of the human spirit. We are all the same in this notion: The potential for greatness lives within each of us.
New Year's Day. A fresh start. A new chapter in life waiting to be written. New questions to be asked, embraced, and loved. Answers to be discovered and then lived in this transformative year of delight and self-discovery. Today carve out a quiet interlude for yourself in which to dream, pen in hand. Only dreams give birth to change.
Night is the mother of counsels.
Nobody is going to love and honor your dreams like yourself. It's really not looking for someone to be your superhero but for us to save ourselves and to really understand that.

No person has the right to rain on your dreams.
Not all lucid dreams are useful but they all have a sense of wonder about them. If you must sleep through a third of your life, why should you sleep through your dreams, too?
Nothing happens unless first we dream.
Nothing is worse than having your dreams come true.
Now, everybody, I suppose, is aware that in recent years the silly business of divination by dreams has ceased to be a joke and has become a very serious science.
No wishes are silly, no dreams remain dreams, for those committed to clear and definitive goals.
Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one's dreams. In what other way can one deal with them? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being.
Ocean is more ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time.
Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.
Oh, I was never a businessman. I was a visionary, a dreamer.
Old age realizes the dreams of youth: look at Dean Swift; in his youth he built an asylum for the insane, in his old age he was himself an inmate.

One of my dreams in life is to do fund-raising for the youth.

One of the dreams on my wish list is to spend more time in Thailand.
One of the most adventurous things left us is to go to bed. For no one can lay a hand on our dreams.

Our dreams drench us in sense, and sense steeps us again in dreams.
Our fathers had their dreams; we have ours; the generation that follows will have its own. Without dreams and phantoms man cannot exist.
Our life dreams the Utopia. Our death achieves the Ideal.

Our politics are our deepest form of expression: they mirror our past experiences and reflect our dreams and aspirations for the future.
Our religion is the traditions of our ancestors - the dreams of our old men, given them in solemn hours of the night by the Great Spirit; and the visions of our sachems, and is written in the hearts of our people.

Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake.
Passion isn't something that lives way up in the sky, in abstract dreams and hopes. It lives at ground level, in the specific details of what you're actually doing every day.
People are never more insecure than when they become obsessed with their fears at the expense of their dreams.
People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they're all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error.

People think it's funny that I enjoy dreaming so much. I just use it as a form of entertainment. It's very private. I don't see my dreams as separate. I mean, half the time I'm wandering around dreaming anyway.
Perhaps life is just that... a dream and a fear.
Physical fitness is extremely important to me. Only if you are fit will you be able to achieve whatever you want to achieve in life; you will be able to pursue your dreams, your ambition, you goals, and the things you love.
Pop culture shapes our ideas of what is normal and what our dreams can be and what our roles are. Politics, of course, decides how the power and the money in the country is distributed. Both are equally important, and each affects the other.
Positional leaders ignore the fact that every person has hopes, dreams, desires, and goals of his own. And leaders must bring their vision and the aspirations of the people they lead together in a way that benefits everyone.
Practise and practise to make your dreams turn into reality.
Prime Minister Sharon, Prime Minister Abbas, I urge you today to end the designs of those who seek destruction, annihilation and occupation, and I urge you to have the will and the courage to begin to realize our dreams of peace, prosperity and coexistence.
Private dreams are the most powerful. You have to dream of success to make it happen, and if you don't believe in yourself, nobody else will. But that doesn't mean you have to go around telling everyone about it.
Pursue your dreams but have a backup plan.
Queen songs tend to be about very personal things: personal dreams and personal ambitions.
Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real.
Reality seems valueless by comparison with the dreams of fevered imaginations; reality is therefore abandoned.
Real shapes and real patterns are things you would observe in nature, like the marks on the back of a cobra's hood or the markings on a fish or a lizard. Imaginary shapes are just that, symbols that come to a person in dreams or reveries and are charged with meaning.

Saddle your dreams before you ride em.
SEALs are human beings. We may all have the same haircuts, but we aren't robots. Some SEALs are great people. Some are not great people. Some have done unspeakably terrible things. You're dealing with different people, different dreams, different desires.

Short stories are tiny windows into other worlds and other minds and dreams. They are journeys you can make to the far side of the universe and still be back in time for dinner.
Skating, I think I was told once, is the second most expensive sport. My family's had to refinance three times - they really want to do anything that it takes for my dreams to come true. I hope to one day have a family that I can do that for and kind of give back in the same way that my family gave to me.
Sleep is the best meditation.

So many financial dreams are thwarted by the failure to act upon good intentions.
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.
Some guys have trouble sleeping the night before an important round. I never have. Invariably, I sleep longer and better, and have more dreams, when I'm in contention and feeling pressure.
Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents, but that shouldn't determine whether you can pursue your dreams.
Some people ask why people would go into a dark room to be scared. I say they are already scared, and they need to have that fear manipulated and massaged. I think of horror movies as the disturbed dreams of a society.
Sometimes dreams are wiser than waking.
Sometimes I wake at night in the White House and rub my eyes and wonder if it is not all a dream.
Sometimes just being on a beach with my loved ones is all the adventure I need. I am a happy camper and continue to be a citizen of the world. I have yet to discover other cultures, other peoples' dreams and treasures. I will always be a traveler who is discovering beautiful Gaia.
Sometimes, the only realists are the dreamers.
Sometimes, you follow your dreams. I say to the young people, 'If you have a dream, chase it.'
Sometimes your dreams come true.
So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again.

Stay focused, go after your dreams and keep moving toward your goals.

Strivers achieve what dreamers believe.
Success is to bring into existence, in adult terms, your childhood dreams.

Take what you can from your dreams, make them as real as anything.
Talking about dreams is like talking about movies, since the cinema uses the language of dreams; years can pass in a second, and you can hop from one place to another. It's a language made of image. And in the real cinema, every object and every light means something, as in a dream.
Talking, talking. Spinning a web of words, pale walls of dreams, between myself and all I see.
Technology has a great advantage in that we are capable of creating dinosaurs and show them on the screen even though they are extinct 65 million years. All of a sudden, we have a fantastic tool that is as good as dreams are.

That was an organic relationship. He reached out to me, and I was like, 'Oh my God, I cannot believe somebody like Laquan Smith wants to put his clothes on me.' He comes from a small place, and he has big dreams, and what I like about him the most is that his clothes curve with your body.
The American culture is pursue your own happiness, follow your dreams. The Chinese side is sacrifice everything for your family; it's all about the group. Those conflicting ideas were always a battle in my head.
The American Dream has run out of gas. The car has stopped. It no longer supplies the world with its images, its dreams, its fantasies. No more. It's over. It supplies the world with its nightmares now: the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, Vietnam.
The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.
The bipolar world of the Cold War is history. The new world order, however, is not the One World dreamed of by Wilsonian idealists.

We will be returning to historical levels of inequality. We'll view post-war America as a kind of strange interlude not to be repeated. It won't be the dreams that we all had that virtually all incomes go up in lockstep at three percent a year. It hurts to give that up.
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.

When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally and protected equally.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be serious, like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor, do they?

When I was a little girl, I did not listen to music much. I did not think that one day I would become a rapper. I was born in a very traditional and religious family.

When I was either 7 or 8 years old, I did a sketch every day of my teacher and what she wore. At the end of the year, I gave her the sketchbook. For me, the sketching of dresses was about fantasy and dreams.

You can go slow. Allow your dreams and goals to change, but live an intentional life.
You can live your dreams, and you can believe in magic. You can live your dreams, and you can be yourself.
You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify, educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you're putting out there, if it's received, great, I respect you for receiving it. If it's not received, great, I respect you for not.
You can plant a dream.
You can't give up on your dreams.
You can't just constantly judge a situation or a person because of what you're used to or how they look. They might turn out to be this sweet man who asks you what your dreams are. You know?
You can't predict it all. People will tell you to plan things out as best you can. They will tell you to focus. They will tell you to follow your dreams. They will all be right.
You can't take anything personally in this business. Follow your dreams, but there is a lot of criticism. You have to brush it off. Everybody is looking for something different.
You can't tell me that dreams don't come true. My life is proof that they do.
You control your future, your destiny. What you think about comes about. By recording your dreams and goals on paper, you set in motion the process of becoming the person you most want to be. Put your future in good hands - your own.
You don't ever want to go out there and not be the best. You want to be the best cop that you can. Be the best writer you can be. Everybody has their goals. Everybody has their dreams.
You don't have to give up your dreams in order to earn a living - they can go hand in hand.
You gotta have a dream. If you don't have a dream, how you gonna make a dream come true?
You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization.
You have a responsibility to move your dreams forward, no matter what.
You have many years ahead of you to create the dreams that we can't even imagine dreaming. You have done more for the collective unconscious of this planet than you will ever know.
You have the dreams that you want, and then you have to do other jobs until you can get to that dream.
You have to be vigorous. That's the only way you are going to get it because everybody has dreams and everybody has goals, but the only people who achieve them are the ones that go after it and don't take no for an answer.
You have to dream before your dreams can come true.
You have to dream dreams to live dreams.
You have to have a dream so you can get up in the morning.
You have to keep going and pursue your dreams.
You have to keep pushing toward those dreams no matter what setbacks happen.
You have to know your identity. It's the biggest thing in wanting to pursue creative dreams.
You have to work hard for what you want to achieve and you have to set goals and dreams and really go for them.
You have to work on your dreams every day, and that's what I am doing.
You keep dreaming big, never put the limit on your dreams, and believe that everything can come true.
You know, my dad served in the President's Cabinet after his time as a governor. He told me he enjoyed being governor a lot more. Now, I understand why. If I do my job well, I can make a difference in people's lives and I can help our children realize their dreams.
You know, one of my biggest dreams in life is to play a Disney princess.
You know, the man of my dreams might walk round the corner tomorrow. I'm older and wiser and I think I'd make a great girlfriend. I live in the realm of romantic possibility.
You know, Willie Wonka said it best: we are the makers of dreams, the dreamers of dreams.
You'll be much more successful if you follow your dreams and follow your passions.
You must recognize, embrace, and be honest about what is real for you today and allow that understanding to inform the choices you make. Only then will you be able to build the future of your dreams.
You need to have dreams and goals in your life, but it's not easy.
Your dreams are what define your individuality. They have the power to give you wings and make you fly high.
You're going to dream no matter what you do in your life, so make those dreams so big that you can attract others who are amazed at your visions and goals.
You're supposed to be using your gifts and fulfilling your dreams, at every age.
Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.
You sail into the harbor, and Staten Island is on your left, and then you see the Statue of Liberty. This is what everyone in the world has dreams of when they think about New York. And I thought, 'My God, I'm in Heaven. I'll be dancing down Fifth Avenue like Fred Astaire with Ginger Rogers.'
Youth is a wonderful thing. What a crime to waste it on children.
Youth is in a grand flush, like the hot days of ending summer; and pleasant dreams thrall your spirit, like the smoky atmosphere that bathes the landscape of an August day.
You've got to have a dream... if you don't have any big dreams, nothing happens.
You white folks see UFOs in your dreams. You don't hear about Martians in Harlem.
